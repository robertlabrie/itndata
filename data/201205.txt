| nom cmt      = I know we don't usually post retirements, but Lidstrom was by far and away the best ice hockey defencemen of his generation, and is widely acknowledged to be one of the best of all time. Seven times winner of the [[Norris Trophy]] (and first European to do so), first European ever to win the [[Conn Smythe]] trophy, first European to captain a team to the [[Stanley Cup]], [[Triple Gold Club]] member (one of just 25 ever), most games ever played for a single team, most games played amongst active players, third highest scorer amongst all active players (and he's a defenceman), I could go on but just see the Awards and Records section of his article. [[Sports Illustrated]] made him their 'player of the decade' and agree with [[Ken Holland]] that he was the 'most valuable player of his era'.

}}

*'''Oppose''' sorry but primary instinct is "who?", then "why?" and then "who cares?" and then I give up.  An "ice hockey player" retiring is far from ITN-worthy. I imagine if [[David Beckham]] "retires" or similar, it'd be laughed out of court.  Really, not of any interest to anyone in the universe outside ardent "hockey" fans. [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 21:13, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Everything above is correct for his career and achievements, but he's ever been considered one of the best 'defencemen' in the game and never one of the 'best players' in the history of the game. Since this is ice-hockey it's not ITN worthy to post a retirement of a player praised to have been the best on a single position, regardless of his achievements in his career. Last year we didn't post the retirement of [[Ronaldo]], who is by far more popular sportsperson than Lidström. Furthermore, players at the end of their careers that deserve more a place in ITN are surely [[Sergei Fedorov|Ferdorov]] and [[Jaromír Jágr|Jágr]].--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 21:26, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
::Not to get into subjective debates, but please explain how Sergei Federov, who only has 27 more career points, 1 less Stanley Cup, half as many All Star appearances, 1 less Conn Smythe and 1 less Olympic gold medal, is somehow more worthy of an ITN nomination than Lidstrom? --[[Special:Contributions/12.41.124.2|12.41.124.2]] ([[User talk:12.41.124.2|talk]]) 19:55, 1 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' due to standing opposition to sports trivia. That said, I'm very upset at the "since this is ice-hockey" attitude. Hockey is taken very seriously by a number of northern countries, spawns number of global tournaments and is even played at the Olympics. A billion people watch cricket, sure, because there are a billion people in India. If we can post "100 centuries", or someone kicking a football into a net 60 times in a season (what was it, some league in europe right? A pretty small subset...), then this nom deserves more than "take your hockey and shove it up your ass". --[[User:IP98|IP98]] ([[User talk:IP98|talk]]) 21:41, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Neutral''' It's widely reported in its own field and Lidström is one of the most recognized European NHL players ever, all true. But I am afraid if this is allowed to pass it would present a precedent to ITN where we'd also have to post all sorts of cricketers, footballers and polo players from every single regional variation of those games retiring, striking a new record, and so on. But in case we want to post more sports, there's an inexhaustible stream of "small" news like this. --[[User:Hydrox|hydrox]] ([[User talk:Hydrox|talk]]) 21:48, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''': A player retiring is not ITN material, no matter how great they were/are. --[[User:Τασουλα|Τασουλα]] ([[User talk:Τασουλα|talk]]) 22:38, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''- Famous, but it seems ludicrous to post a retirement unless they had a lasting effect on their sport.

*'''Support'''. I'm slightly biased as a Red Wings supporter of sorts, but Lidstrom was the first-ever European captain to win the [[Stanley Cup]]. In my opinion, that makes his retirement notable. —[[User:Strange Passerby|Strange Passerby]] ([[User talk:Strange Passerby|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Strange Passerby|cont]]) 11:21, 1 June 2012 (UTC)

:::::::I think you're missing the operative word in your comment here: '''condemn'''.

:::::I can touch on this. I would of opposed the Cricket nom but it was already withdrawn by the time I got here. ''Anything'' sports related that comes up on ITN is controversial 90% of the time. Being opposed to sports trivia in general is fine but people have let their personal biases get in the way in the past, and there's also been a lot of "revenge" opposition voting too.

*'''Support''' per Modest Genius's excellent rationale, and it's worth bearing in mind the that the nominator is not from North America.  I agree that this retirement is less notable than Ronaldo's on a global scale; however, we did post [[Yao Ming]]'s retirement who was less notable as an NBA player but notable for his impact on Chinese basketball; there is some similarity here.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 13:44, 2 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Reluctant oppose''' - Fun news, but it's not even the top of the science section at the BBC or The Guardian (it doesn't seem to even appear in the latter), much less in international sources. Doesn't appear to me to have the notability. [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 18:28, 31 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''' Colipon's argument convinces me. Such nature topics are by themselves rather rare to appear on top news because they describe ongoing processes (e.g. maybe the chick will be eaten by a fox; maybe the notoriously unstable British weather will ultimately scare the Great Egrets away; but maybe this is the start of the colonisation of Britain by Great Egrets - just as the American squirrel is colonising Britain). It's difficult in such ongoing processes to identify the watershed news item. For me, this one seems interesting and noteworthy enough. [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 21:11, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Species are disappearing from and re-appearing in the UK all the time. Here's one from a few days ago: [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/27/short-haired-bumblebee-comeback-dungeness]. Multiply that rate of occurrence by the number of countries in the world and basically it is not an unusual enough event. As for egrets, I've had a few but, then again, too few to mention.

*'''Oppose''' on grounds of extreme systemic bias.  The range of wild species is constantly fluctuating, esp species as mobile as an egret, and such movement is ignorant of national borders.

*'''Oppose''' Unlike Lisbon treaty, this does not require ratification by every country involved.  So long as 12 countries ratify, it comes into effect, so what Ireland does is only one "vote" among 25 (and a "vote in which a 12-13 defeat of the motion makes it pass!).

::The difference is that in the other 24 countries, ratification is much more likely to go smoothly because it only needs the approval by the respective parliaments (which are likely dominated by the respective parties whose prime ministers/presidents agreed on the treaty in the first place). The Irish referendum is a much more uncertain affair, which is why it is dreaded by European politicians. [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 22:29, 1 June 2012 (UTC)

* Shock decision for sure, but I'm not sure how notable the retirement is outside of cricketing circles. Not to take away from his achievements, but his ODI record isnt what can qualify as an "all-time great" player: in terms of overall ODI batting average [http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282911.html he's ranked 22] and he's not even in the list of [http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/83548.html highest run scorers]. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 12:39, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Lots of players "retire" from limited overs cricket during their active career. If he'd said he'd retired from Test Match cricket, then that would be a different story. '''[[User:Lugnuts|<font color="002bb8">Lugnuts</font>]]''' ([[User talk:Lugnuts|talk]]) 12:57, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''.  He's not even retiring, just stopping a particular form of cricket.  For a retirement it would have to be a much more notable player putting the bat away for good, such as Tendulkar.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 13:04, 31 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - Pietersen may not have 18k plus runs like Tendulkar, but if you look at the achievements made by him during his short career in limited-overs cricket (also T20I): He is the fastest player to reach 1000 and 2000 runs in ODIs and was named as "ICC ODI Player of the Year" and "Emerging Player of the Year" in 2005, just a year after his debut. Also he was one of the three English players to figure at the top of the ICC ODI player rankings (In 2007). He is the second leading run scorer and averages around 38 in T20Is, the highest for any player who has played a minimum of 25 innings. Amazing these many records within a short span of time in the limited-overs format is an extra-ordinary feat. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;[[User:Vensatry|<font color = "indigo" >'''Vensatry'''</font>]] <sub> [[User talk:Vensatry|<font color = "Indigo" >'''(Ping me)'''</font>]] </sub></span> 14:16, 31 May 2012 (UTC)
*:I don't think anyone disputes his notablility but the retirement of an athlete is very rarely posted here at ITN.  It would have to be a very notable athlete (as in one of the top two or three players in the game; while I'm not a cricket expert I don't think KP is that notable) or have some other extraordinary aspect.

He is [http://stats.espncricinfo.com/india/content/records/282910.html ranked 46th on all-time Test- players with highest bat average]. Batting average of 49 isn't really an impressive one in Tests, where as an average of over 40 in ODIs is a feat which only few batsmen have achieved. I don't think there is a need to explain his T20I statistics as I've already explained about it. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">&mdash;[[User:Vensatry|<font color = "indigo" >'''Vensatry'''</font>]] <sub> [[User talk:Vensatry|<font color = "Indigo" >'''(Ping me)'''</font>]] </sub></span> 16:45, 31 May 2012 (UTC)

:::: '''Answers''': International cricket, whether one likes it or not, is governed by the ICC. Test cricket is considered the highest form because only a "Full Member" of the ICC is allowed to play it. That is how its done, Ireland (currently an "Associate Member") has started playing more than decent ODI cricket so now they make an application to become a "Full Member" so that they can also play tests. And to your second point, even if we were to consider his ODI career that is ending, he has 4,184 runs @41.84 which pales before contemporary ODI records like Sachin (18,426 runs @44.83), Ponting (13,704 runs @42.03) or Kallis (11,498 runs @45.26). The only retirements from the recent past which I would have dared nominated would have been Dravid's (Test), Ponting's (ODI) or if we stretch back to 2011, Murali's (Test).

*****We usually include information about the blunders when it's decisive for the outcome of a game played in regular time. For the rapid games it's not of much use to analyze games that include more blunders and weak moves, thus producing larger prose than the more important twelve from the original schedule. Another important fact is that the match lacked of wins and blunders on both sides, and even ten games were set to be drawn with peaceful play after 20-30 moves.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 19:49, 30 May 2012 (UTC)

******It does appear that this follows precedent, so I won't vote oppose, but I'd argue that it's an unfortunate precedent. Wikipedia articles, in my understanding, should be accessible to both specialists and nonspecialists. Even as someone who's played thousands of games of chess, it's difficult for me to look over the notation and see what happened in the tournament; surely some prose news story about this can be found that says something to the effect of "The games went into a tiebreaker, but despite the close games, Anand's masterful bishop/knight attack ultimately proved decisive in Game 2."

*My first thought was "burying the lead". Isn't the "new" news the expulsion of the ambassadors?

I wonder if the UN Security Council resolution might fit in the blurb, too (it's a milestone in the UN's role as the first resolution criticizing Assad; Russia and China are now on board). I also agree with Rhodesisland's point that it's worth mentioning that the US, UK and France are involved, or the number of countries. (I believe it's up to nine now).

::: It seems the expulsions are being carried out in mostly Western nations, all mostly made up of US allies.

If all this is just a political vendetta coated by a veneer of constitutional formality, I'm inclined to oppose... [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 22:10, 29 May 2012 (UTC)
**Of course it is; it like the vendetta of the Republicans vs. Bill Clinton in his own impeachment trial. Only the most hardcore/brainwashed Aquino supporter will tell you otherwise. Corona himself [[Impeachment of Renato Corona#January 16|pointed]] it out prior to the first day.

***I'm doubting the noteworthiness of a constitutional event that seems to have happened only for obviously political reasons and only involves the Chief of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. If Gloria Arroyo at some point in the future is convicted of sth, that may be noteworthy; the fact that a never-used-before constitutional gimmick was used to bring down Renato Corona is not im my opinion.

:::::I'm sorry. First completed impeachment trial. 02:24, 30 May 2012 (UTC)
::::I'm questioning the noteworthiness on the basis of a) where it happened (the Philippines vs. the USA for instance), b) who was impeached (the Chief of the Supreme Court vs. a President), c) the reason why it is put up for nomination (being the first such constituion event vs. being in reality a blatant misuse of the constitution for purely political motives). Thus the impeachment of the US president is in my opinion much more noteworthy than the impeachment of a Philippine Supreme Court Judge; similarly the impeachment (or conviction by other means) of Gloria Arroyo would be eminently more noteworthy than the impeachment of her Supreme Court Chief of Justice. Finally, the current Philippine Constitution dates back to only 1987 - not really that old and thus not a real surprise that an instrument of that Constitution is only used now for the first time. As you know, we have hundreds of arguments about the noteworthiness of certain elections. I'm quite baffled that "the first time someone is impeached in the Philippines" is now considered of the utmost remarkability. Is the impeachment of the Head of the Senate of Antigua and Barbuda next? [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 23:32, 29 May 2012 (UTC)
::::: The impeachment of the highest judicial authority in the 12th largest country (by pop) is definitely notable. The political undertones and consequences (especially if there has been a "blatant misuse of the constitution" of one of the largest democracies) only adds further to the notability - we are not sitting in judgement of whether the impeachment is right or not.

::::: If I may add, the [[Impeachment in the Philippines|impeachment has also been in the previous constitutions]], starting with the 1935 one. There has been no shortage of attempts; it's just that no one has succeeded at that time due to the high vote requirements (2/3 to impeach and 3/4 to convict in 1935 vs. 1/3 to impeach and 2/3 to convict in 1987; either way this impeachment would've passed even 1935's high standards.) I don't think we'd need to worry about Antiguan politics; what we should worry about is ITN's blow-by-blow coverage with what's happening in Greece, a country several times smaller than the Philippines' size. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 02:24, 30 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Side comment'''. I think this is a good demonstration of the ITN system doing what it should. Neither article is close to being ready to go on the main page, (in one case due to absolutely no sourcing of the relevant sections, in the other due to the update not having been written yet). As a result, neither article gets a "free pass" to the main page despite being on ITNR. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  13:34, 28 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I've taken care of the orange tags at [[2012 Indianapolis 500]] and it should be ready for posting. [[2012 Monaco Grand Prix]] is still incomplete and needs several updates. I suggest that we should post a blurb about the Indianapolis 500, and then post a second blurb (or edit the blurb to combine the two) once the Grand Prix article is ready.

::Unexpected result I can promise you: probably no Italian on podium for 1st time in many years, winner will be a Spaniard whose highest grand tour finish is 4th, a Canadian with only one grand tour top ten to his name, or a Belgian who has only competed in one GT previous, coming 62nd in last years TdF, and was offered by bookies at 300-1 shortly before the race started.

*'''Support'''. Agree with Kevin, Resolute and Plasma. An unexpected result and I assume a huge result for Canadian cycling.

*'''Oppose''' for now though I'd be willing be persuaded.  The fact is the Giro is normally very much below the TDF, and the Vuelta, in terms of global significance or simply cycling significance.  The top riders often don't take part.  The fact that this is the first Giro without an Italian on the podium speaks to how insular it has been to me.  This strikes me as the equivalent of tennis player ranked below 20 or so winning a [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] tournament.

::Cannot accept that those comments were made out of any knowledge of cycling.

Lance Armstrong only competed in Giro once.  While I would agree the !vote count shows a rough consensus here I wonder what argument has been made in support besides 'historic result for Canadian cycling' which doesn't seem to be enough for ITN to me.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 20:35, 29 May 2012 (UTC)

====Maths problem solved====
Not sure there is an article but [http://www.thelocal.de/education/20120523-42687.html this] story seems to have been picked up by more mainstream media. A school boy has solved 2 problems that previously had only been modeled. Isaac Newton apparently set the problems 350 years ago - path of the flight of a ball, and bouncing it off a wall (I gather). It seems quite encyclopedic, and significant for particle dynamics and ballistics.  [[User:EdwardLane|EdwardLane]] ([[User talk:EdwardLane|talk]]) 08:34, 27 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - This is a great story, but I'm provisionally skeptical that this is going to fit well enough into an existing article to hit the main page. It depends on the significance of the problem, I suppose. Do any of these articles have quotes from mathematicians on the signif. of this finding? Where do you see this one as going into the wiki? A more complete nomination form would be appreciated. [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 08:54, 27 May 2012 (UTC)
**I don't know whether this belongs to ITN, but one aspect to consider is whether or not this solution has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

*'''Support''' per Kiril. And to answer Meco's concern, I started writing up some articles on Azerbaijani prisoners yesterday; I'm hoping to add a section about the human rights angle today. But FWIW, the coverage generally emphasizes that Eurovision has been much less help on the human rights situation than expected. [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 15:38, 26 May 2012 (UTC)
:*I've attempted to add some human rights content to the article, but was reverted; discussion is ongoing, but it appears that editors of the page feel that Eurovision articles have a set policy against including human rights protests, etc. (Why they can't fit that, but can have four paragraphs on how the logo was designed, is beyond me.)[[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 18:47, 26 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' Before this goes to the main page, additional comment would be appreciated at [[Talk:Eurovision Song Contest 2012|the article's talk page]] on the issue of whether the news media's discussion of the human rights angle would be appropriate to include. Per meco above, I'm giving serious thought to flagging this article as POV for its deliberate omission of this topic. Every article I've looked at about Eurovision today has mentioned this topic, but editors continue to argue on the talk page that only positive news should be included, regardless of demonstrated news coverage. Other opinions would be appreciated; my own take could well be in the wrong, too. However, I'd argue that this is not ready for the main page as long as it deliberately omits a major, negative part of the story.

*'''Support''' Support posting but not comfortable with the blurb. Did the Syrian army go around killing people? According to the sources it appears the casualty data is taken from the opposition movement. Are they reliable source? I see no reason to place emphasis on children without concrete prove that children were indeed killed. 16/17 year combat-age males are different than 9 and 10 old year olds.

:* Well, it started. If you don't consider the opposition as a reliable source, what is the source? There is no media at all in Syria now, so don't expect other kind of source.

*'''Support if blurb is rewritten''' - I'm torn on this one. I hate to not report a civilian massacre of this magnitude; I hate ''to'' report it when the only source is opposition activists. On the other hand, Al Jazeera and BBC have this as their top story, and NYT has it in their top 4. Good enough for me. [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 15:51, 26 May 2012 (UTC)
**After reviewing the coverage, there seems to be quite a bit of evidence--video, bodies, etc.--confirming the opposition's claims. (E.g., [http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/homs-may-26-2012-1331]) Al Jazeera certainly seems to believe this happened. [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 15:57, 26 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - The article is improving rapidly. There appears to be no dispute that some sort of massacre did take place; the only question now is the perpetrator (govt. blames Al Qaeda, everyone else blames the govt or govt loyalists). Perhaps a more neutral blurb would be simply "90 civilians are killed in '''[[Houla massacre|a massacre]]''' in [[Houla]], Syria"? [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 16:36, 26 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' With the disparate accounts from the two sides being taken into account, we need to have this reflected in the casualty figures as well. If we only present the higher figures, that is one-sidedly conveying the opposition's version of the events. The report by the Syrian state-owned news agency SANA lists 17 victims and gives no indications that there were more deaths. __[[User:Meco|meco]] ([[User talk:Meco|talk]]) 17:13, 26 May 2012 (UTC)
:<s>*I half-agree. From what I've looked at, world media doesn't seem to be taking SANA's account very seriously, so I feel like it would be a little wrong to give it equal weight with opposition claims. Perhaps, "According to opposition groups, 90 civilians are killed in '''[[Houla massacre|a massacre]]''' in [[Houla]], Syria"? Other alternatives might be "A disputed number of civilians are killed in '''[[Houla massacre|a massacre]]''' in [[Houla]], Syria" or "An unknown number...".

:*Actually, I take that back. BBC is reporting that the UN has confirmed the opposition group figure of at least 90 dead, including many children. Updating the article now.

*'''Comment''' Killings confirmed by United Nations. Support a blurb to something like, ''A shelling attack by the Syrian Army kills 90 people, including 32 children, in [[Houla]].'' Houla is not just one city but a '''group''' of villages. We could just go with Homs because that is the city Houla is located in.

:::I was half way between London and Kuala Lumpur when Facebook got posted, came back here and derided it as an irrelevant fluff piece. Lets never ever speak of it again. Ever. Now the "Top news story" argument is really worthless these days. The google world news top 2 are Irans uranium and egypts run-off, both of which are getting serious sour faces on ITN right now. So we're left with 20bn for a failed bank in a nearly failed state. When you add enough criteria, anything can be the first or the largest. So what it's a fairly large bailout, but a small piece of the broader European debt debacle which has seen Greece pass some bill then eject their PM, Italys PM go away (since somehow dinking little girls couldn't do it), Angela Merkel cry "waaaa Germany had no bailout, we just collected everyone elses, so sucks to your elections the austerity pact stands", the English adopt a stiff upper lip to their own austerity pack, some Irish bank get bailed out, and on and on and on and on and on.

*'''Oppose''' I have to agree with IP98.  These bail outs are becoming run-of-the-mill.  Asserting that it is the first Spanish bank to need a bail out is stretching things a little - first via this mechanism, sure, but the ECB has been throwing money at pretty much any bank that wants it of late.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16282206] [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 00:03, 26 May 2012 (UTC).
::The point is not that this is the first Spanish bank that has to be saved (quite a few savings banks have been already, I believe - Bankia being the result of one of these actions); it's the sheer size of the Bankia deal that's relevant, coupled with the trouble in the regional governments such as Catalonia (which is supposedly the wealthiest of the autonomous regions!).

*'''Weak oppose'''. To be sure this is an achievement, but it has more than feel of a gimmick than something that is going to usher in a new era of anything.

: I wondered about that too, Hot Stop. But it seems the difference is that all those wingsuit jumpers before this finished their jumps with parachutes--using them to actually land.

*'''Oppose''' It's an amazingly cool stunt, but as others have stated, the need for a specially designed landing zone suggests that this isn't a technology that's about to replace a parachute.

It looks probable that a run-off round will be required to determine the actual winner - in which case the run-off will take place on June 16-17. So the blurb should probably say something like "Egyptians vote in the first presidential election since the 2011 revolution" or something like that; and then updated based on the outcome.

:::b) The shooting of Trayvon Martin has far less international importance than this. In that case, both murderer and victim were entirely unknown, whereas here the victim was one of the most famous and controversial political figures in the country.

*'''Support''': Notable for reasons given by nominator. I think the launch itself is good to post - even if it fails, IMO it will be notable enough to post as launch failures are ITNR.

*'''Correction''' - Dragon isn't "docking" with the space station, its [[Spacecraft docking and berthing mechanisms|berthing]].

This same blurb could be used to cover both the rendezvous and berthing. I actually nominated this months ago (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:In_the_news/Future_events&oldid=482468551 here]) and continually updated the nomination page as the launch got delayed, I received no credit what's so ever and I am very angry about that fact.--[[User:Craigboy|Craigboy]] ([[User talk:Craigboy|talk]]) 02:13, 23 May 2012 (UTC)

:Bzweebl claims it has "no political implications of any sort" and everyone else has followed suit without offering any further analysis. The prime minister has interrupted the NATO Chicago summit to comment. The president is visiting the injured in hospital. There is a national day of mourning, flags at half-mast, public television broadcasting classical music. Government is paying all funeral expenses. It is being reported around the world. Kosovo and Turkey are among the foreign political entities to comment. All this is expressed in the article. That begs the question, what are "political implications of any sort" and where are they lacking here? Not every bus gets this sort of tretament. Also, on "plunge", how else did the bus get over the cliff if it didn't fall? One minute it was on the cliff, the next it wasn't. What happened in between? Did a bird pick it up, place it at the bottom of the cliff and set about tearing it apart with its beak and claws? Did it teleport and smash to smithereens in the process?  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.40.111.208|86.40.111.208]] ([[User talk:86.40.111.208|talk]]) 02:35, 22 May 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
::Perhaps "any sort" is a mild exaggeration, but so far the incident does not appear to have affected international diplomacy or any armed conflict--a president making a comment at the NATO summit is very different than changing the course of the NATO summit.

*'''Comment''' You are so hasty and breathless in getting "nominating points" or kudos or whatever it is you feel you achieve that your nominations are littered with typos and mistakes.

::I've always felt Lihaas should make his posts a little more readable, but early nomination (provided its not inordinately early) of an imminent event (election results, rocket launch, sporting event final, etc) gives an opportunity for other editors to take note that an ITN worthy article is in the works, so that they can chip in and improve the article.

*'''Oppose''', without any intention to open [[WT:ITNR|that can of worms]]; I do not regard this as an event of "wide interest" per the main pillar of ITN, and I doubt any newspaper will be covering this in much detail outside of Serbia; I would support only if the person elected has a very good article.

***I am a bit confused. Certainly it was not my intention to be disruptive. All I did was mention two things that are extremely important to ITN, namely, that the event is of "wide interest" (listed in the first paragraph of ITN guidelines), and that there is a good update to the article, which is a normal ITNR rule anyway. It is perfectly reasonable to oppose on those two grounds alone. I don't see why it would elicit such a strong reaction. Moreover, are we then suggesting that any 'oppose' votes, regardless of the stated rationale, should be considered [[WP:POINT|disruptive]]?

*****He is entitled to his oppose since ITNR has now lost the legitimacy it had of reflecting consensus.  The last two discussions on ITNR status for elections have both resulted in ''no'' consensus, not a ''clear'' consensus.  Therefore they shouldn't be listed in the first place.

******The kindest way I can possible describe the "no consensus" comment is "deliberately misleading". Doktorbuk closed the "remove the smallest 20 countries" discussion himself, recognising that there was a clear will to continue allowing the very smallest country's elections to be posted. Serbia is a million miles away from falling into that category. There has been no consensus so far on the ticker (and hopefully we will make progress on that), but whether with the ticker or the current system, there is undeniable consensus to continue posting elections. As for your latter sentence, I wouldn't shed any tears if defending community consensus has the side-effect of making people realise that, in quiet periods, the present system of large numbers of people opposing anything not on ITNR is unsustainable. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  20:14, 21 May 2012 (UTC)

:::You clearly have very different definitions of "wholly unsourced" and "updated enough" than I do.

*'''Question''' Does any RS indicate that this is the ''38th'' summit?  It appears to me that to get to that figure you need to carry on numbering continuously from when it was the G7 and even the G6.

:::Also the article is a copy from the previous summit (As the hidden note says) and there is plenty of synthesis and unsourced bits as in the attendees. That needs to be done first. Hold off till tomorrow with a conclusion statement and, hopefully, sources will appear for the attendees. I cleaned out some of the synthesis and other stuff and tagged where need be.

:::{{ec}}That is hardly a conclusive argument. Facebook had their money the instant the stock was listed, which was the whole purpose of the IPO. They raised $16B which is hardly small change by anyone's standards.  Mark Zuckerberg still has  a controlling interest regardless of what happened today, or even who owns the most shares, because of the way the company is structured.  The idea that shares must shoot up on the day of their IPO to be considered a success  is financial naivete based on the excesses of the last dotcom boom - it is premised on the shares being undervalued when the company actually gets its funds for future investment - hardly in the best interests of the company or its shareholders.

::You make a good case here, but it's a sad irony that so many editors are spending time debating this here, whereas no one seems to have the time to add these claims and their sources to the article. It's gradually improving, but everything from the 1970s down is conspicuously uncited, and the article still seems to have little to no discussion of her impact and importance beyond album sales figures.

*I think it would be a good idea to consider some sort of permanent "death ticker" addition to ITN for cases such as this one. While her death is certainly newsworthy and would be of interest to many of our readers, I feel her importance falls just short of being ITN-worthy.

** Whitney Houston death was sudden and tragic, and completely unexpected which meets the death criteria #1, but Donna Summer death was a unexpected, but an average cause of death as she was still in the public eye until a few weeks ago, but kept her illness closely guarded and it was only known though a few close family members and associates. I haven't had the time to expand the update yet, as this article in the current state is unpostable, but I did research Summer though the available sources in HighBeam and Kevin McE does have a point here about her legacy. Also I want to see a passing admin opinion on the consensus here as some of the opposes is based on the "way too many deaths in ITN" instead of discussing her importance within the music industry. Yes ITN/C needs massive reform, but that reform needs to be discussed in the talk page (or better yet an RFC like what happened with FAC), not in the nominations page. [[User:Secret|Secret]] <sup>[[User talk:Secret|account]]</sup> 06:35, 19 May 2012 (UTC)

No one seems to give a hoot when we have five Nobel Prize stories in one week. Or when there's a slew of elections (and some have balked at the idea of cutting down the number of elections on ITN/R). Why deaths are targeted for this kind of treatment is beyond me.

*'''Support''' &ndash; unexpected death of a very influential figure in disco, which is an influential genre. Many popular performers, including [[Kylie Minogue]], have said that she was a major influence on them and their work. There seems to be a bias against mainstream entertainers / performers being included in ITN. Writers, academics, figures in minor religions, opera singers etc. of whom very few people have heard are included. However, pop singers, actors etc. who have tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of fans are considered not important enough to include. I believe that the deaths of [[Paul Newman]], [[Farrah Fawcett]] and [[Patrick Swayze]] were not mentioned in ITN, which demonstrates my point. How are the deaths of a mainstream entertainers who entertained hundreds of millions of people be of less importance than the deaths of people who had no imput on the lives of 99% of people? Why is 'pop culture' for the masses usually considered unworthy of inclusion, yet 'high culture' with a tiny following considered very important?

::If Kylie Minogue has a mike shoved under her nose and is asked about any singer who has just died, she is likely to say something similar: it's what people who are concerned about the public perception of them do.  I would suggest that any comment made by anyone in the public eye should be taken with a huge pinch of salt unless it is made A) without solicitation, B) without the subject of the comment being present,and C) before the person in question is diagnosed as seriously ill/dead.   [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 16:36, 20 May 2012 (UTC)
::: With Newman, Swayze, and Fawcett, I don't believe that Swayze had such a noteworthy career to even be listed for discussion here, his peak was a few years in the late 1980s and was only known for a couple of films before going back to obscurity. Fawcett had the misfortune to die the same day as Michael Jackson and little notability outside the United States, and I thought Newman was listed in ITN as his acting career was way more significant than other actors that was listed here before, but I would understand any discussion about Newman not being listed. [[User:Secret|Secret]] <sup>[[User talk:Secret|account]]</sup> 06:25, 21 May 2012 (UTC)
:Newman was not featured on ITN, despite easily fulfilling point 2. Why do you understand him not having been listed? If he did not qualify, what does an actor have to do in order to be included? The lead of Fawcett's article states that she was an international pop culture icon; she was very famous in many countries, not just the US. Swayze remained famous and popular, despite his later films being less successful than Dirty Dancing and Ghost. Robin Gibb would likely have been excluded had he not written songs for other artists as well as for The Bee Gees. There seems to be an unwritten snobbery in that a opera singer or classical conductor whom 99% of people have never heard of is included because they are admired by a small number of upper class and upper-middle class people whilst popular entertainers who entertain millions of ordinary people are excluded. In what way does Summer, who won Grammy Awards, not fulfil point 2? Her 1970s music has been sampled on songs during recent years by popular artists. An high-profile example is [[Naughty Girl (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Naughty Girl]] by [[Beyoncé Knowles]], who had not been born when Summer was in the charts in several countries with [[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]].  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/188.29.2.36|188.29.2.36]] ([[User talk:188.29.2.36|talk]]) 12:05, 21 May 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::Well, with technology you never know if someone will shatter another record tomorrow.

::*That seems fair until you take a look at the [[National_electoral_calendar_2012]]; if there are not changes to ITNR guidelines, and if I'm doing my calculations correctly, an election will ''always'' be part of ITN at 80-90% of the time during the year in ITN.

*'''Support without clause pending update''' it's not up to us to decide what elections are legitimate and which aren't.

*'''Support''' I'm all in favour of decent updates and all, but in an article which anyway contains little prose, I think it's much more important to make sure all tables and numbers are up-to-date than requiring a precise 4-line-update in prose.

*::How is 'ganging up' on an ITNR item any ''worse'' than 'ganging up' to create it... it seems to me 3-4 users here already oppose this post; had all these users simply ''showed up'' at its original 'induction' to ITNR, it would have never passed in the first place. <P>I also don't suspect that popular opposition will bring down too many items.

*'''Oppose''' on article quality alone, and before I'm accused of being anti-basketball note that I came close to opposing the Premier League season article on quality grounds. I would like to remind all editors, even the three who feel that their opinions now determine sitewide consensus, that under the current system article quality is the only valid opposition to an article on ITNR. In fairness at least one of those editors has tried to change ITNR itself, but in the meantime we need to make the best we can of what we have. Rather than try to get this specific article removed from ITNR, to instead deliberately [[WP:POINT|disrupt ITNC to prove a point]] is neither constructive, nor collaborative, nor likely to achieve anything given that the article is not currently of high enough quality to be posted. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  18:40, 15 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''- ITN/R is a guideline that reflects the consensus of the community and must be followed, so if you want to oppose this on any grounds other than article quality, you need consensus to remove it from ITN/R first.

::That is a selective application of the guidelines.  The quid pro quo is that items on ITNR should have clear consensus for them.  The above discussion shows that this is far from the case.  The correct course of action in that eventuality is to strike its ITNR status.  As various discussions recently have alluded to that is almost impossible at present since minority voices tend to assert a lack of consensus as an argument for retention (the guidelines are premised on the opposite).

:::::::"Grand Prix". "Formula One". Both are recognized as regarding auto racing. I definitely think "Formula One" is more recognizable to people who don't follow the sport than "Premier League" is. Further explanation seems unnecessary, especially when the story isn't the outcome of the race, but rather the protests. (Same goes with the Los Angeles Dodgers story.) I wouldn't be shocked if you found a true sports story that didn't mention the sport, as consistency is not at 100 percent here, but the point is this is not, nor has it ever been, exclusive to football stories. For some events, especially individual achievements, it's much easier to just mention the profession (e.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=486424977&oldid=486160104 "American golfer"]), but that's not always possible. For examples of where this "In [sport]..." has been done before, you have to go back a bit of time since we don't post sports events often, and many that we do post have the sport in the name of the event: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=461893152&oldid=461892095 "In auto racing..."], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=457963615&oldid=457952058 "In baseball..."], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=451356539&oldid=451352152 "In basketball..."], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=451204939&oldid=451162025 "In Gaelic football..."], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=445410804&oldid=445402536 "In golf..."], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=441208527&oldid=441176001 "In cycling..."], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=437568425&oldid=437560710 "In tennis..."], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:In_the_news&diff=434587575&oldid=434537653 "In ice hockey..."].

*'''Comment''' Not comfortable linking the Ahmed al-Gizawi scandal with the aid. Source does not mention Ahmed al-Gizawi. Unless a source exists drawing a direct connection between the aid and the specific diplomatic incident, the blurb shouldn't be posted. Also - another critical fact, only 1 billion of the 2.7 billion in aid is coming from Saudi Arabia at the moment. The other money hasn't been released yet, so we can't say Saudi Arabia has "sent" Egypt 2.7 billion USD.

**'''Posted'''. I've altered the blurb. While the sources do not mention the name of al-Gizawi, they do mention the recent diplomatic crisis: [http://af.reuters.com/article/currenciesNews/idAFL5E8GA6ZK20120510?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true "An Egyptian official said last month Saudi Arabia had agreed to transfer funds including the $1 billion deposit by the end of April.

*'''Comment''' I'm saying there is not enough evidence (IMO) to link Saudi Arabia's aid to Egypt - which isn't a new development - to the brief diplomatic incident. Saudi Arabia's financial commitments to Egypt is much bigger than this al-Gizawi scandal. It just seems rather ORish to circle the aid around the scandal when reliable sources aren't framing the news that way - [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57431634/egypt-secures-financial-aid-from-saudi-arabia/ example]. And as I said before, Saudi Arabia has not sent 2.7 billion USD in aid. In fact, some of the aid is not "being sent." At least 700 million USD will involve the purchase of [http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/41012/Business/Economy/Saudi-financial-aid-to-Egypt-will-continue-Ministe.aspx Egyptian treasury bonds].

**The CBS news article you mention as an example in fact describes the al-Gizawi controversy in great detail. And the new blurb does not say the aid has been "sent". Please feel free to suggest a better blurb, if you have any. --[[User:BorgQueen|BorgQueen]] ([[User talk:BorgQueen|talk]]) 14:01, 13 May 2012 (UTC)
***Keep reading: "Egypt's Minister of International Cooperation, Fayza Aboul-Naga, said the deposit is for eight years and is part of Riyadh's previous commitment to Egypt." Much of the "aid" Egypt is "receiving" from Saudi Arabia was agreed to prior to this diplomatic incident. The source does not explicitly tie the incident and the aid. And like I said before, Saudi Arabia is not "beginning to send 2.7 billion in aid" - the 2.7 billion is part of a financial aid package, a sizable chunk of which includes the purchase of Egyptian treasury bills. This really isn't a huge story, I wish more discussion was allowed before posting.

::::* To be clear: my immediate first thought on hearing this news was that it should be an ITN. But if we're sticking to our guns here on the level of importance for a person's death to be noted in ITN, Sandak's passing doesn't meet those (and hence why we have the Recent Deaths part); in particular, if a significant component of ITN is the ability to update an article to reflect the ITN aspect (as was the case in the more untimely death of [[Adam Yauch]]), death from complications from a stroke at 83 isn't a whole lot to write home about.

There is a link to "Recent deaths" and I think that serves the readership well. Much like elections, deaths are given extreme undue weight on ITN.

However, the problem remains that these '[[low-hanging fruit]]' posts on ITN get through much more easily than stories that perhaps require more digging, contextualization, nuance, and does not easily fit under a 'category', making ITN essentially a platform for reporting election results and obituaries.

*'''Needs update''' currently one sentence. Do a couple of paragraphs with reactions from prominent people in his field, and you can probably clear ITN/DC #2 and get an easy support.

*'''Oppose for now''' - as I mentioned on the discussion page, I am willing to be convinced that an Election Ticker may be a solution to the "small country elections" dilemma, but trying to implement it in a rushed way, without a discussion having occured here (remember [[WP:CONLIMITED]] - a limited consensus by a small group of editors may be overridden by a broader consensus of the whole community) is in my opinion quite unacceptable. In particular, as WFC highlights, there isn't even an example of how the Election Ticker would look like for the 4 elections mentioned below! Also, major points are still totally unclear - which elections will be highlighted? Only current ones? Also upcoming ones? After how many days will elections featured in the Ticker be removed? Why wasn't the Election Ticker discussed here earlier, instead of 1 day before these elections? [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 12:22, 6 May 2012 (UTC)
::It was mentioned in Hungary below several days ago. The outlien so far whichi suggested above, would be a trial version. Everone is welcome to discuss and proposals hae been invited as well.

*'''Oppose, somewhat strongly.''' The whole point of tickers is to unify a single event with continuing updates, such as the Olympics, which is its original usage. It has since been appropriately applied to other events as well (e.g. Arab Spring), but I feel something like this is what leads to abuse of the ticker.  It should be reserved for special circumstances; specifically events, not for thematic purposes (such as elections in this case). '''[[User:Spencer|<span style="color:#082567">Spencer</span>]]'''<sup>[[User talk:Spencer|<span style="color:#FFBF00">T♦</span>]][[Special:Contributions/Spencer|<span style="color:#FFBF00">C</span>]]</sup> 00:54, 7 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' in principle (beyond the fact of it lacking consensus which I stated above). I have two primary reasons for opposing this: firstly, it gives undue weight to elections by prominently marking them off in a special field. People often accuse ITN of being too politically oriented, and this would hardly help. Secondly, it fails to solve the problem of microstates being given undue weight&mdash;which was the original point at issue&mdash;since it reduces them along with all other states to the same place. Yes, this doesn't preclude important elections from being posted to the main section, but it still leaves microstates (potentially along with other things like regional elections) on the same basis as other states. If that's not an issue, then why are microstates an issue at all? (For the record, I don't think that they are, since I'm inclined to trust the criterion of sovereignty rather than editors' assessment of the notability of a state, and I'm also very much in agreement with Tariq in his comment about notability [[Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)#ITN|here]].)

*'''Oppose''' as premature.  Personally I haven't gone through that in full yet.  I made some initial notes but considered it not worth pursuing further while the very same nominator made a separate proposal to can ITN entirely.  I may or may not be the only one there, but any assertion of consensus seems premature while for the bulk of the discussion the whole of ITN has been under a sword of Damocles.  Now that discussion has closed leave this one a bit longer for consensus to form.  This would be a big change and it has to be seen to be truly reflective of the balance of opinion.

::::I share some of your frustrations with the user in question and agree he can brush up on his Wikiquette, but the 'election ticker' was the work of multiple editors with diverging views, including myself, that advanced this idea as a middle-ground consensus solution workable to almost everyone.

*'''Support''' in principle, but I'd like to respond to the opposition first. It is fair to say that consensus is 'premature' on this issue. There seems to be two issues - a number of editors do not see there to be a problem ''at all'', others see there to be a problem but doesn't agree with the solution, others yet would like to advance this solution. On a balance, it seems the users discussing this issue are split on quite a few levels, but that leaves us with the [[status quo bias|undesirable status quo]]. If we are saying that there is not enough consensus for the elections ticker, there is perhaps even less consensus for retaining the status quo, as it has been raised over and over again as a problem by a very wide range of users. The ticker is the closest we have come to a solution on this issue, and is supported by a number of editors whose opinions originally differed (particularly between Bzweebl, Lihaas and myself) - representing a lengthy process of discussion, consultation, and compromises, and reflects the best available 'going consensus' on this issue. <P> Moreover, right now is an opportune time - as there are about five to six elections going on this week, all of whom would normally pass the ITN/R threshold. It would mean that potentially 4/6 stories on ITN this week would be election-based, something that I am sure is not desirable to any of us. We can do this trial run an see what the reaction is from the community at large (not just the ITN/C regulars) and then work from there. <P>Moreover, there needs to be some recognition from the 'pro-status-quo' users that there is obviously a problem, and instead of continuing to simply filibuster all changes, to suggest a workable change.

*'''Comment''' Let's please also remember that the original key concern, as far as I understood it, was elections in microstates (Kiribati, Palau, Barbados, and the like). None of the below countries counts as a micro-state; even Armenia, the smallest of these four, is way bigger and more important than any of the microstates that cause so much criticism. Thus, using the original problem (should micro-state/small country elections be highlighted on ITN?) to advance the Election Ticker in this case is simply misleading. As for the argument of having 4 elections at once - well this simply happens sometimes. If 4 items are election items on ITN for a couple of days, I think we will all survive - we just have to find enough other stories the next few days so that the elections "fall off" the ITN list...

The current state of the postings is undesirable to most. I have revamped the election ticker to make it less convoluted. While I understand there is considerable opposition to this proposal I still consider it much better than indiscriminately slapping every single election happening this week as we have been doing.

:If that's the problem why not simply remove elections from ITNR (a solution I increasingly support), since this also indiscriminately slaps every single election onto ITN? To reply to your point in another section: you stated above that the present ITN is already an election ticker; if that's the case then how would this change it? The point about undue weight is that elections are being given a special field of their own, not that they're present. --[[User:Tyrannus Mundi|Tyrannus Mundi]] ([[User talk:Tyrannus Mundi|talk]]) 13:08, 8 May 2012 (UTC)
::Two things. 1. it reduces the ''weight'' given to elections, particularly in a week like this one. 2. It is meant to abide by the principles of curbing systemic bias by maintaining small-country posts, and does not arbitrarily discriminate based on a country's size and influence (a sticky problem from the past). This marks a concession from both sides of the debate.<P>I recall in the ITNRE 'backroom' discussion, you had fairly consistently argued for retention of existing criteria (i.e. status quo), yet when that option proved unpopular among the majority and we collectively proposed a ticker, now you are opposed to it and saying that you support removing elections from ITNR altogether. Instead of opposing everything that is thrown your way, could you propose some sort of workable solution that is aimed at advancing instead of derailing consensus? [[User:Colipon|Colipon]]+<small>([[User talk:Colipon|Talk]])</small> 13:45, 8 May 2012 (UTC)
:::If someone changes their opinion to support you, then they're "advancing consensus"; if someone changes their opinion but remains in opposition to you, then they're "derailing consensus"? That sounds a lot like the "consensus" has already been decided from the beginning. The entire ''point'' of consensus is to drop unpopular opinions and look for a compromise. As for being consistent, you'd do well to re-read what I stated in support of the status quo, which was explicitly very ''tentative''. I didn't want to go into discussions of particular people, per [[WP:PERSONAL]]&mdash;discuss suggestions, not people&mdash;but since that's been broken repeatedly I feel I'm justified in making this response, and now that I've done so I'll withdraw from this discussion. I'm not comfortable with the way this discussion has turned into accusations of irrationality.

* I'm inclined to disagree. Seeing a few versions of the ticker now (which, BTW, all miss the Greek election results - certainly of more importance than the London ones), I do feel that putting blurbs of the elections themselves on ITN is preferable. The hugely important French presidential elections get totally obscured - the election of F Hollande was however one of the most notable event in the last few days, and certainly more notable than some of the items that would remain listed on ITN (e.g. the Bolivian nationalisation, which was noteworthy at the time, but outdated by now). In all, I feel that the drive for the election ticker has become disconnected from the original problem - i.e. that the elections in micro-states have undue weight on ITN (none of the currently discussed elections is a micro-state election). Now it's being argued instead that the election ticker should be used to combat the amount of election blurbs on ITN - a totally unrelated question! Ultimately, it seems to me that the election ticker has become a solution in search of a problem... [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 22:38, 8 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' I would support posting the results of a "Mayweather vs. [[Manny Pacquiao|Pacquiao]]" fight (if that ever happens), mainly because of the level of media attention and prowess of both fighters. While Cotto is a great fighter, I don't think it's on the level of what a Mayweather/Pacquiao fight would be. Grading what is significant or not will ultimately be opinion-based, since almost every notable fight usually has one of the many boxing titles for each weight class on the line. From there, there isn't much else to go by other than opinions.

::: The last ITN posting of a boxing match that I can find was [[Manny Pacquiao vs. Shane Mosley|Pacquiao vs. Mosley]] in May 2011. Since then, there have been several other nominations, including one for [[Vitali Klitschko]] a few months ago. Unfortunately, when it comes down to it, because of the way boxing is structured compared to football/baseball/american football is (as in, with a regular season, playoffs, and championship), public opinion is what ultimately decides if a fight is significant or not, since it's the fans that will put butts into the arena seats, or pay money for the [[Pay-per-view]]. Boxing fans will have their favorite boxers, which will usually sway their opinion, and the casual fan will usually go with whether they've heard of the boxers in the match or not, or what friends/coworkers or [[SportsCenter]] says is a big fight. It's a terrible way of measuring it, but I don't see a better way to do it for sports like boxing or [[UFC]]. Personally, I think that most boxing matches just don't get enough attention to be ITN-worthy, even the ones I pay to watch. What would make a "Mayweather vs. [[Manny Pacquiao|Pacquiao]]" fight ITN-worthy in my mind is the fact that even though each fighter is far apart on the particulars of the match, you see a ton of media coverage about their disagreements or speculation on when/if they will fight, even though the match looks more and more unlikely every day.

*::::The [[A-League]] :) [[User:Jenks24|Jenks24]] ([[User talk:Jenks24|talk]]) 10:47, 6 May 2012 (UTC)
*:::Reply to John: You seem to make confusion between the FA Cup and the Premier League. The latter is a tournament played in a league system which identifies those teams who will compete in the European leagues and those who will be relegated in lower-classed leagues. So, the Premier League is a high-class tournament on the grounds that the other played in a league system are placed lower on the hierarchy in the English football. On the other hand, there is simply not a such hierarchy regarding the domestic cups. The FA Cup is the main domestic cup and automatically is the strongest one, though it is massive that includes participation of clubs in the lower leagues. Some may argue that the Carling Cup is familiar competitive tournament, but it's a different story and hardly comparable. Moreover, you mention the Champions League and the Europa League that are continental tournaments with the latter being a second-class tournament. I don't deem it appropriately to use them as a specific cutoff in this case, because they differ from the FA Cup in the system of play and the region that they cover. Lastly, this Cup is one of the very rare domestic football cups played in more than one country and the final game is usually followed by an essentially larger number of spectators of any football game in any other leagues throughout the whole season. Many always claim that ITN should document something that is important for the English-speaking readers, and though I don't agree entirely on it, this is something that obeys the scale towards it.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 11:31, 6 May 2012 (UTC)
*::::Kirill you've sidestepped my argument that whatever the importance of the FA Cup in English football generally, it's simply not regarded as that important by the top English sides that routinely field 'B' teams in the tournament while focusing on the EPL and the Champions League.  Due to that I am not comfortable with labeling it a 'high class professional' competition.  I would agree with your last sentence; however, even in England I'm not convinced that the FA Cup final receives any more coverage than any one of several high profile league matches (e.g. the Man City/Man Utd match a week ago).  If you look at sports coverage today on websites it appears that coverage of the FA Cup final has already been superseded by coverage of EPL matches which will influence the league title.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 11:53, 6 May 2012 (UTC)
*:::::It's a relative matter to discuss for the ranking, but I'm pretty sure that the English officials have a high regard for this Cup besides the significance of the Premier League. For the final game yesterday, Chelsea and Liverpool did not play with their 'B' teams and the game was followed by roughly 89,000 spectators at Wembley, which is the highest attended football match this season in the English football, and the main page of BBC Sports portal was shadowed with every single information about the game.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 12:27, 6 May 2012 (UTC)

:*While on the surface it looks like a routine maintenance exercise, in reality the Japanese government has until now refrained from restarting any reactor that was shut down for maintenance since Fukushima. Given that Japan had 54 nuclear reactors overall, having them all offline for maintenance is really not a routine act. In particular, local politicians oppose the restarts - the restart of [[Oi Nuclear Power Plant]] for instance has been delayed by concerns from the governors of the surrounding prefectures. Thus, we are de facto in a situation where no-one knows for sure when nuclear power will be produced again in Japan. [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 21:10, 5 May 2012 (UTC)

I don't know that we can post the death of every influential 90s musician, but since they were still at it, and prominent in their field, I think his death and the presumed end of the beastie boys makes this "ITN worthy". --[[Special:Contributions/98.203.99.251|98.203.99.251]] ([[User talk:98.203.99.251|talk]]) 20:35, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

:::The word "his" is a singular pronoun that takes a singular, male antecedant.

To me this is one of those records you haven't heard of, but when Messi breaks it, then it's all over. I mean, Müller have some notable goal-records (most World Cup goals, most goals in Bundesliga, most goals in European Competition, most goals for Germany), but this record isn't even mentioned in his wiki-article, so it can't be that noteworthy.

*'''Oppose''' - The use of the term 'pink tide' makes me think this nomination is somewhat politically motivated. But more seriously, a friend with close ties to Bolivia described this as 'the annual May-day nationalisation'. It's my impression that this is a predictable and unsurprising aspect of the current government's policies. In this respect it is unlike the recent Argentinian nationalisation, which occurred precipitately, in the context of a complex international dispute both with Spain and the UK.

* '''Comment'''. A prefectural level city isn't comparable to a city (even accepting the distinction with the urban core) -- on the [[list of urban areas by population]] Suzhou is ranked at #88, below many US cities. The fact the city has a long history isn't relevant to the discussion. A more convincing argument needs to be made for the notability of this development, especially given the brief nature of the news link provided: systemic bias shouldn't be used as a ''carte blanche'' for anything outside of the West to be posted. --[[User:Tyrannus Mundi|Tyrannus Mundi]] ([[User talk:Tyrannus Mundi|talk]]) 15:31, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
**Thanks for the input. I agree the brevity of the source makes this entire story look rather tenuous - but then we are an encyclopedia and we don't only expound on conventional 'news' stories in ITN. Point taken about 'prefecture-level', but again I mentioned city proper as a pre-emptive defence against that argument. If you want to argue agglomeration then the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou-Kunshan-Taicang area is basically one gigantic city with some 20 million residents similar to the NYC-NJ region or Greater LA. I digress... the point is, this city is among the world's largest. This is a minority topic. + systemic bias. [[User:Colipon|Colipon]]+<small>([[User talk:Colipon|Talk]])</small> 15:55, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
***The point about the definition is that you're comparing it against other cities to show notability, so you need to use roughly similar definitions to avoid comparing apples and oranges. If it's viewed as an agglomeration then to show notability it should be compared against other agglomerations, not other cities. However, if it's viewed as an agglomeration then this is a story affecting only a particular part of that agglomeration. As I said, there should be some firmer indication of why this is notable, instead of why it might be seen as less notable (i.e. systemic bias) -- e.g. demonstrating broad coverage in non-Anglophone newspapers. --[[User:Tyrannus Mundi|Tyrannus Mundi]] ([[User talk:Tyrannus Mundi|talk]]) 16:13, 2 May 2012 (UTC)

***** I agree with Tyrannus Mundi's point. Chinese cities often confuse people in the West for semantic reasons - a "prefecture-level city" usually denotes sth akin to a region or a province in a Western country, or a prefecture in Japan, and not a city in the Western sense. You could compare it to Madrid: Madrid proper has approx. 3 mn people, while the Community of Madrid (= a region of Spain) has approx. 6 mn people. Or to Osaka: Osaka city has 2,7 mn inhabitants, while Osaka Prefecture has 8,8 mn. Similarly: saying that "Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou-Kunshan-Taicang area is basically one gigantic city with some 20 million residents" is a somewhat arbitrary definition - given the proximity of all these cities to Shanghai, you might as well argue that they are all part of the Shanghai metropolis... This is not to say this news shouldn't be posted - it might well be - but it shouldn't be considered on the basis that Suzhou is a major world city - it's not even a Top 10 Chinese city...

*'''Comment''' I would agree with posting this on the tech minority topic grounds (we haven't posted infra developments for a while, have we?), but there are a few concerns: the commercial service actually began already on 28 April, so if we posted this we would already be 4 days late on top of the usual 2-5 days to establish consensus. On a much more minor note, the article needs some WP:MOS polish. Generally speaking, there are lots and lots of infra development works in Eastern China, and a metro opening in a city of 4 million (urban) is arguably notable, but infra works being a minority topic I would tip to support; bias or no bias, West or East.  --[[User:Hydrox|hydrox]] ([[User talk:Hydrox|talk]]) 17:09, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support'''- This is the biggest infrastructure news for a while, which is a minority topic that gets even less prominence than the other minority topics, and counters systemic bias, which we have had a lot of recently.
