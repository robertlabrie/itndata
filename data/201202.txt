*'''Oppose''' The Monkees were significant enough that I know who they were, but not significant enough to be posted ITN IMHO. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Muboshgu|Muboshgu]] ([[User talk:Muboshgu#top|talk]]) 01:03, 1 March 2012 (UTC)

*'''Weak support'''. I don't think this can be opposed for lack of significance. In their day, the Monkees were absolutely massive. If we can post Whitney Houston and REM splitting up, we can surely post this. However, I had a look through the article and parts of it seemed plain confusing. If it gets improved some then I might strike the "weak". --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 02:14, 1 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' - lead singer of one of the 5 most popular bands of the 60s ''and'' one of the top few "teenage heartthrobs" of the decade. If The Monkees were a contemporary band, there would be zero doubt in anyone's mind about posting his death. --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 04:44, 1 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' per Muboshgu. Not quite at the level of international significance where putting the death up is justified.

*'''Support'''  Far bigger hit tally than many of those who have been featured here, and profile through the TV show that was way beyond that enjoyed by even the most popular bands today.  66 is untimely death for those who consider that a relevant criteria.Iconic character of era.  Without the Monkees TV show, we wouldn't have had the Jackson 5ive and all that came from that.  <small>Wikipedia is for 40somethings as well as all you youngsters out there</small>  [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 07:25, 1 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' As per Kevin, mostly. I am not wet behind the ears (indeed, in two weeks time, I'm even less wet). This is a significant (and upsetting) death of an icon in his time and from a band which did far more than just I'm A Believer. A significant development which fits the ever shifting rules of ITN.
*'''Support''' per Kevin. He's right, the Monkees were as important to the disenfranchised youth of the 60s as REM was to the disenfranchised youth of the 90s. --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 12:42, 1 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' I was a bit redundant to support, but his death is top story everywhere, being compared to Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston deaths by the publisher of Billboard. That's extremely significant. [http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/01/showbiz/davy-jones-teen-idol/index.html?hpt=hp_c2], I don't think any other member of the Monkees deserve a posting in ITN if they die.

*While I do think it's significant and do think it deserves posting, I really can't argue with HiLo48's argument that it's really not of international interest (so far as I know NASCAR doesn't even hold races outside of the US), and it's interest within the US even seems to be somewhat regional (more interest the further south and east you go). If consensus comes out that this is of enough international interest to post by all means consider this a support, but I have my suspicions that my perspective of its suitability for ITN is different due to living in the US, so otherwise '''neutral'''.

** The results of the Daytona 500 was posted several times before, including last year. NASCAR is the biggest level of stock car racing, the most popular auto racing circuit in the United States, with the number of fans beating every sport but American Football. The main reason it's not as international as Formula One is because of their schedule doesn't give it enough time to travel to different counties (they had races in Japan before though). I would '''Support''' if we posted last year championship race and result, which was considered by many auto racing observers to be the best ever? I remembered they posted in previous years but I can't remember if they did last year. Way more popular than Indy Car here. If [[Danica Patrick]] won or finished in the top 10 it would have been a no-brainier addition for many of the commentators here.

**Why? First of all the whole article is new, is itself an update, as through this prize Wang Shu's international notability is clearly established.

In that context the death of outside journalists is significant, albeit they may report the story in very different ways to the West. I would point out that RT are running with the story [http://rt.com/news/homs-conflict-jounalists-crackdown-945/]. As for the "Euro-centric" claim, Colvin was American. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  17:20, 22 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' per ModestGenius. I know the Western media is putting this into their headlines. But I believe Wikipedia should try to be better. Thousands have been killed in Syria recently, likely including many Syrian journalists. In this light, it would be somewhat arrogant of us to post the deaths of two Western journalist. (Note that I'm not accusing the editors who supported this of anything. I hope I can disagree without offending anyone.)

*'''support''' I think it's ridiculous to oppose because we haven't been updating with civilian causalities.  It's a weak point of ITN; simmering conflicts with no particular new news are usually not featured.  This came up with the 2011 Japan earthquake, the Occupy protests, and maybe even the Libyan civil war.  A week or so ago it was proposed that we update on the Homs bombardment but it was opposed due to nothing new coming out of it.  This is a major story that's being reported by the media and is definitely ITN worthy due to the Libya photographers <s>present</s> precedent.

*'''Support''' " Two Westerners get killed and suddenly we post this, after weeks of dozens of Syrians per day being killed whilst we did nothing." The real double standard is when mass killings occur in Europe/America, ITN proposals are typically expedited straight to the front page without serious opposition. On the other hand, when hundreds of civilians are killed in an Arab country, the community is largely silent or indifferent. The fact that two mainstream journalists were killed is unfortunate. But remember editors rarely respond in great numbers unless some American/European is killed in the crossfire.

:'''Comment''': I strongly agree that boxing deserves some sort of representation on ITN. I'm not fully conversant with the international framework for the sport either but from what I can make out, we have both amateur boxing (Olympics/Asian Games/CWG etc) and professional boxing (for prize money). In professional boxing, we have 4 bodies - WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO. It doesnt seem to have a unified international structure (like FIFA for football or the ICC for cricket). I suppose we can feature the top one or two organisations from amongst the four. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can help identify it. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 04:41, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
:'''Oppose''' A sport that cannot organise a proper world championship reeks of non-merit among their respective "championships". I doubt if you could ever gain agreement on ranking the bodies. These "championships" are an insult to those who have won real world championships in the past. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 05:16, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support pending update''' The WBC is one of the four boxing Majors, and this is the Heavyweight Championship, which has historically always been the glamour weight class.  However, the article needs a better update; it has only a single sentence.  If the article is updated with a paragraph describing the fight, I'd fully support.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 05:26, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
:'''Oppose''' Apart from the viewpoint that we should not be giving any promotion to an ill mannered thug like Chisora, or credibility to a sport that gives him a platform, there have been, by my calculation, 70 heavyweight "world championship" fights in the last 10 years.  Given that a story remains typically on the main page for 5-6 days, that would mean that boxing occupies ITN space for 10% of the time.  Major unification bouts (in any weight category), those that genuinely gain widespread attention of those beyond the fan base of the sport, ''might'' merit inclusion, but not routine defences, many of which (including this one) are widely perceived to be of little sporting merit (Haye-Harrison anyone?)  [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 08:57, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
::Well yes, I do agree some of the tricks Chisora's pulled and has pulled in this match and those before were very unsportsmanlike, and did not do anything good for the reputation of the sport or the title. But then again, someone being a "thug" is not really a real argument. --[[User:Hydrox|hydrox]] ([[User talk:Hydrox|talk]]) 13:59, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
:'''Oppose''' for the reasons given above. Boxing has become very hard to support for ITN because of its desire to split into little grouplets. I don't agree with Kevin's view about promoting "ill mannered thugs", but everything else is pretty much what I think.

:'''Comment''': A passing read of the comments above seem to suggest that ITN shouldn't post ''anything'' about boxing ''anytime'', while we have such events as hurling and Gaelic football ("Top level of championship in multi-national sport") in ITN/R. Not only is that stupid, but reeks of bias. The problem is to select which boxing fights would make it to ITN. I had previously suggested on ITNR that any fights that include both boxers in the top 5 of any of the [[pound-for-pound]] lists by ''[[The Ring]]'', BBC, ESPN, Yahoo Sports and probably [[Sports Illustrated]] (if they maintain such lists) could be considered (not necessarily ITN/R) for discussion. I'd reckon the [[Manny Pacquiao]] vs. [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] fight will pwn the page view stats of events such as the massively-supported-in-ITN Heineken Cup. The boxers in the pound for pound lists usually don't meet each other very often: this is not tennis where the best players face each other in the final; some don't meet in their entire careers, due to size difference. Another good milestone is if a boxer wins his fifth world division title. There had only been five [[List of boxing quintuple champions|quintuple champions]] in history, so the sixth person to be included in the list should be at least considered for discussion in ITN, and not dismissed outright. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 09:48, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
::Any chance you could rewrite that in plain English, without any insider jargon? I'm sorry, but to me it was largely incomprehensible. If the best "players" don't meet each other, there can be no real champion. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 09:57, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
:::There's no "real champion" in "all of boxing" since boxers have weigh around the same a day before the fight, hence there are chances where the best players would never meet. For example, a fight between Klitschko and [[Pongsaklek Wonjongkam]] is a mismatch since Klitschko is a lot bigger than Wonjongkam, and the former will beat the latter to a bloody pulp before the first round is over (in short, it's not fair). This is unlike Nadal vs Djokovic where they'd meet every time they make it to the final even though Nadal (hypothetically) is a lot bigger than Djokovic. Hence, there are "pound for pound" rankings to sort out which boxers are the best assuming they had the same weights. Hence "pound for pound." (This is the same in sports such as [[mixed martial arts]] and [[weightlifting]].)
:::The issue with these "pound for pound" rankings is that these are completely subjective, hence in my examples I used as much as 4 lists; most of the time these lists include the same boxers in the top 5-6 anyway.
:::In a boxer's career he usually starts in the lower weights, as he progresses he steps up to a heavier weight limit. If a boxer is really good, he can win at least one title in any of the four orgs (WBC, WBA, IBF & WBO) or the [[lineal championship]] in every weight division. If he wins at least once in five weight divisions, it's a rare achievement. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 10:08, 19 February 2012 (UTC)
:::: While I can see its hard to identify a ITN-worthy championship/combination of championships, I agree with HTD that we shouldnt be dismissing this outright, we should at least make an attempt to see if we can arrive at some possible criteria to identify major boxing achievements rather than give it up just because it looks difficult (which admittedly it does). I am not sure if this is the right forum and we will also need few people with a more than decent knowledge of the sport to step up and take this forward.

*'''Support when substantially updated''' tl;dr: If we post boxing, there should be certain standards of what is a "big match". And this was probably one. –– Vitali Klitschko is–almost without a doubt–one of the greatest legends of contemporary heavy-weight boxing. There are some opposing opinions above on the grounds that professional boxing has no one well-organized international body. These comments are true but entirely trivial, and if followed systematically would lead to us not never posting any pro boxing. Obviously we ''should'' post some pro boxing, it is anyway one of the most popular sports in modern history, but it's not ITNR because matches have to be decided on a case-by-case basis due to the fragmentation issue. This match–I think–passes the threshold as a very highly-anticipated and reported bout ("klitschko vs chisora" on Google News gives >2000 articles) and for reasons including the fact it was for the most esteemed weight class (heavyweight) title,  Klitschko's legendary standing and what happened in the weight-in and the anticipation it built. Also, Chisora is a Briton, so this is of special interest to one of the main target audiences of the English Wikipedia. --[[User:Hydrox|hydrox]] ([[User talk:Hydrox|talk]]) 13:59, 19 February 2012 (UTC)

::The harmonization of boxing into one organization, if it ever happens (it won't), is immaterial. The power is brokered by the matchmakers; these orgs just sanction matches; their title belts are next to worthless as the main prize are the guaranteed purses and the [[pay-per-view]] payoffs. In fact, this was the deal breaker in the Pacquiao vs. Mayweather; earlier this decade Pacquiao was ranked among the best, and he didn't even have a world championship.
::Also, the heavyweight title isn't well followed anymore. Probably because the Americans suck at this weight level. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 02:24, 21 February 2012 (UTC)
:::People often cite the split of title belts as a reason nobody cares about boxing but I also think the fragmentation of boxing might be overrated; people may be overlooking other reasons for boxing's decline (a growing perception that it's 'barbaric'; lack of title holders from the US, UK instead of Ukraine; the rise of other sports).

:'''Note:''' He does NOT face impeachment, only lifting of immunity. There's a big difference for the Bundestag between allowing prosecution by independent judiciary, and impeaching the President themselves. Even if the intended prosecution is successful and he is convicted, Wulff could still legally remain President (though there would of course be huge pressure put on him to resign). Still, it's a first in post-war Germany, so '''weak support''' if the Bundestag acts accordingly. --[[User:Roentgenium111|Roentgenium111]] ([[User talk:Roentgenium111|talk]]) 19:19, 16 February 2012 (UTC)

:::No, I wouldn't call this "impeachment", nor does Wikipedia. Impeachment (with removal from office) is possible in Germany, as explained on [[Impeachment|WP]]: "The Federal President of Germany can be impeached both by the Bundestag and by the Bundesrat for willfully violating German law. Once the Bundestag or the Bundesrat impeaches the president, the Federal Constitutional Court decides whether the President is guilty as charged and, if this is the case, whether to remove him or her from office." (See also the corresponding German article [[de:Amtsenthebungsverfahren]].) But this (remote) possibility has nothing to do with the present situation of lifting of immunity (which is also routinely done for MPs accused of some crime, e.g. for [[Jörg Tauss]] in 2009). --[[User:Roentgenium111|Roentgenium111]] ([[User talk:Roentgenium111|talk]]) 21:02, 16 February 2012 (UTC)

Al Shabaab is made up of various tribes across Somalia. Who knows where their true loyalties lie. The true scope of this "co-operation" is also unknown, beyond "we pledge allegiance to you".

*: The fact that the article is being heavily edited may be a good reason to wait on posting the ITN until that settles down. Right now, at least before posting this, one of the statements in the death section would be the type of thing that would fail BLP ("acting erratically" ) even though sourced and the like.  There's reactions from people that were close friends of hers like Bobby Brown, for example, that can also be added.  If she died of old-age natural cause, then yes, there's not much to say about the death and a few lines would be sufficient.  Here, a death at 48 in a hotel room the day before the Grammy's, is sparkling a lot of rumor milling, and it is best we only post once RS's settle down as to the cause. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 04:18, 12 February 2012 (UTC)
*:{{edit conflict|2}}<br />That the article is wildly unstable is an argument ''against'' posting the item at this juncture.<br />Again, the section's purpose is to direct readers to an encyclopedia article providing a substantial amount of information about the event, ''not'' to report breaking news and throw them into the fray.  Posting the item now would disappoint visitors by sending them to an article providing little information about Houston's death.  Would these individuals check back later (after the article ''has'' been substantially updated)?  Perhaps not.  <br />Indeed, there's overwhelming consensus (including ''my'' support) that the item should be posted.

An argument against this based on th fact that "we aren't sure" is, in my opinion, very poor.

Like I said, there is no way to prove that she was the last veteran overall due to the large scale of the First World War and the time that has passed, but it has already been proven that she was the last veteran of which we had 100% undeniable proof of her service.

*'''Comment''': With regards to people debating whether this should be featured now, or on the anniversary of the coronation, it appears that the Commonwealth's news organisations are marking the occasion now.

Furthermore, the "Official Website of the British Monarchy" has the frontpage headline (and fulltext) of "[https://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2012/TheQueensDiamondJubileemessage.aspx The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Message]". Whilst there will definitely be celebrations and events throughout the year, the 6th of February is clearly when the world is marking the official occasion and so I believe we should too.

*'''Support, but with better blurb'''.  Breaching Lake Vostok is an important event.  However, the 20 years of drilling part is basically wrong / misleading.  The first ice core drilled at Vostok was in 1970 (forty years ago), and there have been drill operations at the site most of the years since then.  In 1990, they began the fifth long core at Vostok (dubbed 5G), which stopped being drilled in 1997 after achieving the record depth of 3623 m (which has been the world's longest ice core, until the decision to extend it).  After an eight year break (the longest gap in drill operations at Vostok since drilling began) they decided to extend core 5G (now named 5G-1) to reach the lake, and that operation started in 2005.  Personally, I'd just leave off the 20 years part, since they have either been drilling at the site 42 years, or on this extension for 8 years, but focusing on the 22 year history of hole 5G (including the 8 year hiatus) seems strange.

*'''Support''' although I would prefer a change of emphasis.  My thoughts on reading the blurb are "who cares about the ice core?", particularly "do we really need to wedge in the exact length of the core?" and "do we really need to name Vostock station when we give the location (Lake Vostock) elsewhere?" 
:There's only limited space in the blurb and it isn't a question of what can be wedged in, but what can be taken out and still put the story into context.  For me there are two main points here: a) Lake Vostock has been reached and b) Lake Vostock has been isolated for however many million years.  The reader can click through for anything else. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 21:02, 6 February 2012 (UTC).
**Added the word "isolated" to the blurb. The fact that it has been isolated for many million years would be more important if they find some life there, but that will be no earlier than the end of the year if ever. We'll have a chance to report it then. The ice core record is very important since it could extend the knowledge of paleoclimates etc. As for mentioning the [[Vostok Station]], it just identifies the team and the location.

Isn't it surprising that the British paper [[the Guardian]] has one of those live feed pages for, in Doctorbuk's words, a sport "supported only by a minority of sports fans across the world, is US-centric as a subject, is US-centric in terms of article content, does not promote Wiki's world view, and is a non-notable event in the context of sporting headlines"?

*'''Oppose''' for my reasons quoted by the nominator. The sudden upsurge in British interest in this event is a curiosity, not proof of a trend. The sport does not feature on the broadcast media news, for one thing, and there has been no build up on the broadcast media, only on-line where there is no guarantee that the domestic audience really cares. Clearly this is not something for which Wikipedia's world wide audience would find notable, interesting or worthy of front page inclusion. {{unsigned|Doktorbuk}}

: '''Comment''' Well, alot of discussion have taken place here. First, what is unneutral is to say that the deaths were in clashes between the two sides, because neither the regime nor the opposition have said that such a thing happened, i think that we are assuming neutrality rather than trying to be really neutral. If you want the actual two sides views, the opposition says that 400 people were killed by a heavy shelling launched by the Syrian army, and the regime says that 400 people (Actually he didn't mention a number, but whatever) were killed in an armed bands operations in Homs, that is all. Second, from my view, there is difference between the blurb itself being unneutral (For example, saying revolution not protests, or martyrs not deaths) and the case it is showing just a one-side view, because the blurb can be neutral in showing the opposition view even if it didn't mention the other side view, in addition to the fact that the sentence is too short to mention two views (At the time of [[2011 Damascus bombings]], the view of the opposition for the hand of the regime in what happened were not mentioned in the main page news section). So, i think the current blurb is good, and mentioning the number of deaths is very important (note that 200 is the least number mentioned by all agencies, even the russian), and the clashes sentence is far away from true --[[user:عباد ديرانية|aad_Dira]] ([[user talk:عباد ديرانية|talk]]) 00:21, 5 February 2012 (UTC).

*'''Not ready''' one of the bolded articles still has a serious issues template (neutrality) on it.  Remember ITN is for highlighting ''quality'' content. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 02:51, 5 February 2012 (UTC).

::: Please note that the problem of the article is solved now, because a [[Homs Bombardment (2012)|new article]] has been created for the massacre, and we can link the blurb to it directly. Personally, i don't see a big need for mentioning what is related to the monitors. Also, what is the point of "civil unrest" part? The sentence in general sounds like a 200 people have died surprisingly in an obscure conditions, why don't we say simply that an artillery shelling on the city of Homs by the Syrian forces caused 200 deaths and stop circling around it? It is simple, all news agencies tells you in the bold font: "The Syrian regime has killed 200 people in Homs". Remember [[WP:UNDUE]], if the media didn't give much attention to the regime story of the armed bands, we don't have to mention it, because it is not notable, what is notable rather is the 200 deaths caused by the REGIME story, it is neutral and notable and we can say it simply --[[user:عباد ديرانية|aad_Dira]] ([[user talk:عباد ديرانية|talk]]) 05:32, 5 February 2012 (UTC).
:::: Agree that civil unrest has no place in the blurb, neither does "international media." It just sounds awkward. [[User:Wikifan12345|<span style="color:#6E6D6D">Wikifan</span>]]<sup><small>[[User_talk:Wikifan12345|Be nice]]</small></sup>  06:17, 5 February 2012 (UTC)
:::::becuase that is POBV. its a CLAIM by the opposition (no bias there?) and the international media who cant verify it because there is a media blackout and they rely on claims. And we dont credence to waht the media gives attention to or not because this is NOTNEWS. Its clear from the statements above that this is POV. Futhermore, the govt denies it happened (or at least via shelling()[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 06:24, 5 February 2012 (UTC) )
:::::: What is the relation between [[WP:NOTNEWS]] and [[WP:UNDUE]]? The news agencies is simply the primary source of news articles on Wikipedia, so it does not require alot of thinking to conclude that what is notable and unnotable depends on it. You guys sounds like trying to make the things neutral but you don't know how to do that, so you just try to change things that don't need to be changed. Yes, the regime has shelled Homs and killed 200 people, there is nothing unneutral here, this is the opposition story and this is what was the top news in the international newspapers of 4th February. If you want to tell the regime story, so shall it be, but don't change the main story told by all worldwide media and invent Wikipedia very own story of what happened in Syria yesterday --[[user:عباد ديرانية|aad_Dira]] ([[user talk:عباد ديرانية|talk]]) 07:05, 5 February 2012 (UTC).
:::::::Your statements are showing more of a bias each time. FIRST you say that WP should not "invent" stories, whoich is true, but the invention is being made on behalf of 1 side and unverified (not to mention dubious). WP is not a weblog/social media (by intention anyways). if as you say its the primary source here then thats explicitly frowned upon as biased. (can bt cited but needs to be backed elsewhere). notability does NOT depend whatsoever on what the news agencies report. there is a lot of garbage, even if RS, that is not notable enough to be on here. Perhaps Wikinews is better using the logic behind the arguement here. Thereis no affirmation of shelling other than the opposition claim (to bolder their view/garner support of oppression) and the media that have repeatedly said reports cannot be confirmed as they are not present. to present it we need BOTH stories, not seperate stories.[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 08:10, 5 February 2012 (UTC)
: Yes, i am biased to the revolution, i support the revolution, there is no reason for me to hide this fact, also you are biased against the revolution, it is clear that you are Shia Muslim, but all of these facts does not prevent any of us from the right of discussing things out here. When we publish the opposition view of events on Wikipedia we does not invent things, but we simply tells what the opposition said, but when we invent a new thing that neither the regime nor the opposition said like that the current blurb is a different thing.

:: ''An '''[[Homs Bombardment (2012)|artillery shelling]]''' according to the Syrian opposition and armed bands attacks according to the regime causes 200 deaths and and 500 injured in the city of Homs.''

:::: As Greyhood already said, "regime" is a negative word for "government", so it should be avoided. And if the article describes only the alleged shelling, and not the rebels' attacks, as the wikilinks suggest, then it is not neutral. If it covers both, then wikilink like this: <nowiki>[[Homs Bombardment (2012)|cause 200 deaths]]</nowiki>. "Bands" is not really idiomatic; it sounds like it could almost be "bandits", and could be any side. "Rebel attacks" would be clearer. Also, qualify the numbers with something like "reportedly".

The city essentially looks like [[Battle of Misrata|Misrata a couple of months ago]].

This pseudo-"he said, she said"-journalism thingy you guys are trying is pointless. It kinda reminds of the early days of the Iraq War, when [[Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf]] constantly assured the media that there were no Allied forces in Iraq, saying that in front of TV camera with American tanks tracking in on him in the background. Essentially that's what Assad is saying: "there is no uprising!" "then why's the Army all over the country, killing people?" "all foreign terrorists!"

*'''Comment''' I believe this is notable because it represents the end of the US federal involvement in any investigations into LA's alleged doping.  This is key because the federal government has powers unavailable to the press and to sporting authorities and there was a significant possibility that such a Federal investigation would shed light that 15 years of muckraking by the media has failed to uncover.  It is now far more likely with this federal investigation behind him that Armstrong will remain officially clear of doping despite widespread belief that he is guilty.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 15:26, 4 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' The first Support post says it's the end of the story. No way. The rest of the cycling world is unlikely to accept what a US inquiry says about a US cyclist. Would the dropping of a Spanish government enquiry remove all doubts about Alberto Contador? The fact that no reasons were given for dropping the investigation won't help either.

A little harsh there,  HiLo48. I felt the article was updated enough for the nomination, put my rational for thinking he was important/famous enough for inclusion, and politely made the nomination for listing. Sorry if I didn't follow the "correct structure"; as it's my first time nominating, I didn't realize there was such a strict process to follow. But you're comments were rather insulting and certainly put me off wanting to ever nominate again.  Maybe I'm being a bit sensitive, but you're comments did smart a bit.  Not sure if I care to come back; thanks. [[User:Rhodesisland|Rhodesisland]] ([[User talk:Rhodesisland|talk]]) 03:24, 3 February 2012 (UTC)
:Look. There are very obvious, very clear instructions at the top of the page. I make no apology for asking that they be followed, even by new editors once they have had them pointed out to them. But even worse was the seeming support you received from very experienced editors who also could have helped, but didn't seem to care about the rules, just wanting to attack me. I would have helped, because I suspect this is a valid nomination, but being non-American have no idea who this person even is. You have been badly let down by fellow American, experienced editors who could have made this work, but preferred a fight.

*'''Comment''' - HiLo, you really need to moderate your rhetoric here. Multiple exclamation points and bolded, all caps comments are not conducive to collaborative editing. I'm going to ask you, with all the due respect one multiple contributor deserves from another, to stand down if you cannot control your temper tantrums and stop biting newcomers here, no matter how much you think they deserve it. We need more people helping at ITN and Wikipedia in general, not less. Cannot you at least strike out or refactor your bluster above? And if not, would an admin take a look at issuing a warning or block if HiLo persists? It seems to me we have to draw a line somewhere.

**I've requested Hilo to consider refactoring/striking and to find a better way to express him/herself here. Hopefully there won't be a need for any further adminstrative action over this editor's participation here. [[User:Mjroots|Mjroots]] ([[User talk:Mjroots|talk]]) 08:59, 3 February 2012 (UTC)
***Thanks.  I have also left a note of apology on Rhodesisland's talk page in an attempt to undo the damage.

****Does anybody else here really carefully read what others have written? I did not explicitly attack the newbie. Now, have another read, of everything I have written, please. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 10:46, 3 February 2012 (UTC)
:I agree that you didn't explictly attack this newbie, but you're response was a bit extreme. If you feel the other experienced editors were striking back at you, perhaps there's some bad blood already there over other times you've been a bit harsh?
*****This is not about what you say, but the way that you say it. There is a discussion regarding your ongoing disruption of ITN on the talk page.

::for the record it seems like a case of the [[pot calling the kettle black]] as elucidated by the fact that the nom WAS clarified with the comment that "could someone explain who he was." well to that must be said: "does anybody here really carefully read what others have written" + the fact that saying "did not explicitly attack" is directly contradicted by "Look. There are very obvious, very clear instructions at the top of the page. I make no apology for asking that they be followed, even by new editors"[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 18:31, 3 February 2012 (UTC)
*As advised, I've looked at the template to see how I should have gone about the nomination; but I quickly got lost. Personally, I think it is too complex and uses too many of the mark up symbols and makes it confusing for newbies to use. When I have another nomination, I will take the time to try it, but can't promise it'll be "correct".[[User:Rhodesisland|Rhodesisland]] ([[User talk:Rhodesisland|talk]]) 22:38, 3 February 2012 (UTC)
::good to see you bakc. give it a go and /or ask for help.
:::Incidentally HiLo, please take the time to practice what you peach and do read what it says for the nom format: "'''Preferably''' use the template... "[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 01:47, 4 February 2012 (UTC)
