*'''Tentative support''', but the phrase "tribal clashes" is pretty vague and doesn't really explain what is happening. Maybe "Clashes between X and Y tribes in Sabha, Libya..."?

**I would keep "tribal". How about "Six days of '''[[2012 Sabha conflict|tribal clashes]]''' between the [[Toubou people|Tabu]] and the Arab Abu Seif in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], Libya kill 147 people"?

*'''Strong support''' Seems like a very important clash after few tribes announced their strive for secession from the country. It is fairly well covered through the media and the death toll is extraordinarily high.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 19:17, 31 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Weak oppose''' Looking at the events of today (the date it is nominated under) I see 16 deaths reported - that isn't hugely significant in the realm of armed conflict.  To get the higher death toll means running a narrative thread through a number of separate incidents and treating them as a group, which becomes more of an ongoing problem as opposed to a specific ''event'' which is generally the focus of ITN.  If we are to lump them together and treat them as a group we really need an independent RS that does the grouping of these particular events together, as opposed to them simply being an otherwise unconnected subset of difficulties in post-revolution Libya.

:::Quite possibly the most outrageous claim of equivalence I have ever read.  Tendulkar's record is the culmination of an international career in a major international sport that started 10 years before this kid could walk.

::''"There were particular challenges at the MegaRamp at Woodward West in Tehachapi, California where the jump was filmed by several cameras. It provided some of the speed and velocity needed, however the 50-foot gap in the ramp was a hinder to keep the momentum going all the way through to the quarter pipe. This was overcome by the creation of a custom built roll-over feature which allowed the skater to drop in on the 70-foot-tall and roll right over the large gap, thus allowing the speed to be maintained."''

:::: Levy is right. I might have worded it a bit strong, but this story isn't a joke or a mockery. Baseball is the top sport in several countries, including Japan so it's not an "North American obsession" like American football is. But a 2 billion dollar sale of a sports team that was expected to fetch around 700-800 million at the most? It has major implications in the global sports and business no matter what sport is played. It gives the estimated value that similar squads such an English Premier League team go for if it become available, and shows that big record breaking acquisitions like this are not impacted by the recent recession, and other record breaking deals in other areas can happen. It was a top story in BBC sport where the Dodgers were called [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17534738 one of the most prestigious franchises in sport], still the second biggest story on [http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/americansport/2012/03/2012328111458364268.html Al-Jazeera sport over 24 hours later], lots of coverage in Mexico [http://www.centraldeportiva.com/beisbol/detalle/%27Magic%27+Johnson+compra+a+los+Dodgers-48244] [http://www.centraldeportiva.com/home/detalle_opinion/Dodgers%2C+%C2%A1vendidos!-437] Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and just about every other major global business news source there is.

*'''Comment''': Most elected candidates are [[Independent (politician)|independents]], so the blurb "X wins a plurality" won't work as in elections where parties play an important role.

:::But it doesn't make sense to claim that a party "wins" the election with four out of 35 seats. That's not what I'd call "winning" an election. I don't know anything about Abkhazian politics. But I assume that most of the "independents" are pro-government, while this [[Forum for the National Unity of Abkhazia|National Unity Forum]] seems to be oppositional.

*'''Support'''. ITN has posted the elections of both absurdly small states ([[Kiribati presidential election, 2012|Kiribati]]) and mostly unrecognized states ([[Republic of China presidential election, 2012|Taiwan]]). If Wikipedia is indeed "a portal to democracy around the world", then neither Abkhazia's size nor its diplomatic status should disqualify it. [[User:Shrigley|Shrigley]] ([[User talk:Shrigley|talk]]) 20:41, 26 March 2012 (UTC) 
*'''Oppose''' to present a party that might have won four out of 35 seats as the "winner" of this election. The "winner" of the election is a bunch of individual, independent candidates and not a party. If no one here knows how to find out who and how many of them are "pro-government independents" or "pro-opposition independents", the traditional blurb ''"X has won a plurality"'' or ''"X has won the election"'' is not applicable. But if we don't know who has "won", then what are we going to report? ''"An election in Abkhazia has taken place"''? That's not very interesting for ITN. Unlike elections in other countries, this election seems not to have any impact on who is the head of government or which party or political force has the power in this ''de facto'' country.

I quote from the ITN/R page criteria for elections: ''Disputed states and dependent territories should be discussed at WP:ITN/C and judged on their own merits.''So instead of outright dismissing it, lets discuss this on its merits. '''(2)''' Irrespective of how many states recognize and dont recognize, Abkhazia is de-facto independent and no longer under Georgian administration (unlike for example, Tibet which claims independence but is still under Chinse administration).

*'''Oppose''' It's definitely an interesting story, but I don't think it's significant enough of an event to be ITN worthy. Had he been the first to make the decent, It would definitely be worthy, but he's the third person to reach the bottom([[Jacques Piccard]], [[Don Walsh]] in 1960). The fact that it's the deepest Tweet ever recorded is a neat fact, but not a historic event (After all, we've already had astronauts tweet from space!). If it was to be put up on ITN, I would agree with [[User:Rhodesisland|Rhodesisland]]: the blurb should be more along the lines of "[[James Cameron]] reaches the seafloor of the [[Challenger Deep]] in the vessel '''[[Deepsea Challenger]]''', becoming the first person to do so in a solo voyage". - [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]]) 05:48, 26 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' This is not news, it's a vanity project by a man richer than the east coast of Africa. It might be "notable" in the sense of being "unusual", but not in the sense of "being important".

*'''Oppose''' The voyage stage was not of such length that the solo element is notable: 5 hours in a small room on one's own is not remarkable. Lots of short-term publicity because of who he is, but in terms of achievement/outcome/discovery, this seems to be a rich man's toy rather than important scientific development.

:::We should also cite it as the first to do so making it more notable.[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 08:54, 26 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' While not first, this is still a significant technological achievement - after 50 years, there is again a sub that goes that deep down and it's better equipped. And that's only the first of several subs being currently developed, so this seems to be the beginning of a new era of deep sea exploration. --'''[[User:Tone|Tone]]''' 09:45, 26 March 2012 (UTC)
I really have to disagree w/ [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] --and that's not something I do often. This is the first in a new way of exploring the deepest levels of the ocean.  Earlier I compared this dive to Lindbergh's solo flight, and that comparison seems very apt to me.  Yes, Cameron wasn't the first, neither was Lindbergh; they were both the first to do so SOLO. I don't think people in Lindbergh's time thought his feat was "rich man's toy rather than important scientific development" even though all he did was fly across the Atlantic. In comparison, Cameron took scientific samples, videos, and documentation of an area of our world that we know less about than we do the Moon or Mars. The scientific knowledge that we gain from his trip may not be realized for years, but it will be vast and important and this dive is just the first of several dives to come. Have we become so cynical in our modern age that we won't recognize that fact just because of who the explorer was? I certainly hope not.

*'''Support''' - This is an engineering milestone equal to the moon landing. The fact that it is Cameron is beside the point; he piloted a vessel deeper than anyone else in history to 16,250 PSI of pressure, solo.  Never mind that Cameron designed it himself.  Never mind who paid for it. I suppose you would have said "big deal" to Armstrong on the moon too. "Yawn, bad audio." If you actually use your brain and think about it, it is truly remarkable, notable, and it absolutely deserves to be on the front page. --[[User:BradPatrick|Brad Patrick]] ([[User talk:BradPatrick|talk]]) 14:23, 26 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''support''' - If a rich man build a solo ship and flew to the moon, it would be notable, even though we've been there. Hell, if the US, Russians or Chinese land a person on the moon, we'd probably post that. There have been more than twice as many trips to the surface of the moon by humans as there have been trips to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. - '''[[User:Floydian|<font color="#5A5AC5">ʄɭoʏɗiaɲ</font>]]'''&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">τ</font>]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">¢</font>]]</sub> 16:59, 26 March 2012 (UTC)

*There is one main issue here — James Cameron. Some of the opposes/supports are based on the fact that it's him. Others are based on the fact that on its own, it's notable.

*'''Comment'''  You will see from my talk page that I have been called ignorant for voting Oppose to this nomination. It is remarkable that someone has considered such a retort to my vote here. I am not impressed by a celebrity driven 'event' making the first page of Wikipedia and make that quite clear again. That an editor has chosen to name call as part of a cheerleading exercise for a film director's vanity project is staggering. I urge Administrators to consider this uncivil act as part of the process in getting this story past the nomination stage. Is this REALLY an achievement? Should the front page REALLY feature a sham act of nonsense ("First Tweet sent from the sea!") that brought about an unprovoked verbal attack on a long-standing editor?

*'''Comment to the detractors''' who cares if it was James Cameron? It was the first solo dive, the first dive in more than 50 years, and spent more time on the bottom than Trieste. We post an endless parade of celebrity and sports trivia here. Is the first solo dive (and second ever manned dive) to the bottom of challenger deep somehow less newsworthy than 100 centuries in cricket? Really? I'm honestly shocked at the outward display of contempt to this story which I expected to be an easy pass.

*'''Comment'''. A Brownlow Medal, an [[Leigh Matthews Trophy|AFL Players Association MVP]], Melbourne Football Club Team of the Century, multiple [[best and fairest]]s, multiple [[All-Australian]]s, Australian Football Hall of Fame, Victorian representative – all after first playing the sport at 18. He became a pioneer for gaelic players to come over and play the Australian game; many clubs now have Irish players on their lists. But it's his work after football that is really inspiring. He founded the Reach Foundation to help at-risk teenagers and was twice named [[Victorian of the Year]] for the work he did with Reach. Later, he became President of the Melbourne Football Club and I don't think it's an understatement to say that he saved the club well also fighting brain cancer. Stynes was a great footballer and an even greater person, certainly the greatest I've ever had the chance to meet; my words can't even begin to do him justice. I've been pretty emotional about this over the last few days and I've tried to put this into words a few times and failed. I don't think it would be appropriate for me to vote on it, but it would be great to see him up on the main page. [[User:Jenks24|Jenks24]] ([[User talk:Jenks24|talk]]) 08:26, 22 March 2012 (UTC)

If some group claimed responsibility for the attacks then it would be noteworthy, but for now, it's just another random tragedy. That the victims were children is meaningless.

::My support is not based on claims of motivation. (''Contra'' the claims of a Muslim perpetrator, I've seen it asserted that Muslims have also been targeted.)

*'''Support if merged, oppose if not.''' The notability here is that people have been shot dead in separate incidents, days apart, in a developed country, and by what is believed to be the same culprit(s). That the latest set of victims were civilians and that anti-Semetism might have been a motivation are both factors which have added to the interest in this outside France, but they are not the decisive factors.

*'''Comment''' This is something that I would like to support, but the acquisition was principally announced on 16 March and we already have the earliest news in current ITN that happened on that date. It's also weird to me the article about [[Bell Media]] to lack general financial information and have a much shorter copy than the other about [[Astral Media]].--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 22:18, 18 March 2012 (UTC)
**We could push this discussion back to the other discussions on 16 March. I logged in today and was surprised to find that it hadn't been included in the news, so I suggested it now. In regards to your comment about Bell Media's financial information, I think a lot of the information is held at the parent company's article page, [[Bell Canada]]. Thank you for your comments and I look forward to other people's comments (and hopefully support).

*'''Oppose''' We have previously posted when people (including Tendulkar) have passed the biggest records in a particular sport. IIRC these have included, in cricket: most Test runs or wickets, and first ODI double hundred by a man. This new record is not of the same order, being a slightly artificial combination of two other stats (Test and ODI hundreds), a metric that received little or no consideration until Tendulkar approached this 'landmark'. While any story involving Tendulkar will garner a great deal of excitement in cricketing circles, I don't think this is the sort of really top record that attracts more widespread attention.[[User:ReadingOldBoy|ReadingOldBoy]] ([[User talk:ReadingOldBoy|talk]]) 12:54, 16 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''': Significant landmark in cricket which probably will never be achieved or overtaken by any of the current players. After Ponting's retirement, Kallis is closest with 57 but he's already 36. ReadingOldBoy has a point while saying that its definitely a new metric, but I would think that is because nobody else has come close. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 12:59, 16 March 2012 (UTC)
: Addendum: The fact that several current and former cricket greats, the ICC chief exec and the Indian PM issued congratulatory statements within minutes should count towards notability within the field (if there were doubts about that).

*'''Weak support'''. Clearly, this is a significant sporting news story. It's not really like setting any old record, because it's a first.

*'''Further Comment''' The suggestion that this establishes a landmark seems somewhat crystal bally, and raises the questions of why 50, for example, international centuries wasn't a landmark and why this metric is only of interest now that there is a particular arbitrary landmark, unlike total Test centuries where a batsman's total is of interest regardless of how many (or few he has). We don't know if this establishes a new benchmark, total international centuries, or whether (as I suspect) now that Tendulkar has his hundredth we go back to never talking about this business of adding Test and ODI (and presumably 2020) stats up.

'''comment''' I didn't nominate this as 'just' another horrific traffic accident wasn't really world changing, but yes if the bus crash makes it through the 'other stuff happens' criteria then this should be equally notable. [[User:EdwardLane|EdwardLane]] ([[User talk:EdwardLane|talk]]) 16:52, 14 March 2012 (UTC)
*I seriously object to any arguments along the lines of '5 Bangladeshis is worth at least one Belgian'.  What logic is that?  Are we conceding that South Asians are worth less than Europeans but not that much less?  Let's just treat the two stories as separate incidents and best judge them on the same criteria, considering article quality and relative notability.  I'm not an expert on the matter but I believe fatal boat accidents in Bangladesh are common.  According to this surely incomplete [[List_of_accidents_and_disasters_by_death_toll#Maritime|list]], this would be the ninth recorded maritime disaster in the country with 100+ deaths.  However, land transport accidents (rail and road combined) in Western Europe aren't unheard of and have been posted at ITN.  I'm inclined to support this nomination pending an article.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 17:44, 14 March 2012 (UTC)
*I can't consider supporting before an article has even been written, but am inclined to agree with the nominator's argument on relative notability. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  18:10, 14 March 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. I am yet to form an opinion on whether to support this or not, given that it isn't very uncommon for these kinds of incidents to happen in the subcontinent. But I take objection to the nom's comments on "5 Bangladeshis equal to 1 Belgian" or whatever, though the comment probably was intended only to compare it to the Swiss accident.

*'''Comment''' agreed, the "5 for 1" stuff is entirely unnecessary.  Let's not start !voting for ITN items with an immediate dig at the process, utterly pointless.  [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 19:41, 14 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Let me clarify myself''': I agree that each nomination is to be treated separately, and without an article and an update, this has no shot at going up on ITN. But if a threshold regarding notability is being set, then that has to be applied uniformly. I've witnessed previous nominations regarding incidents involving loss of life in Africa, Middle East, South America and Asia being opposed on the grounds of "that sort of stuff happens there all the time". So clearly, life a person from these regions is not being valued here on ITN as being equal to one from the developed world. I'm from the Subcontinent myself, and have no interest in portraying a South Asian life as being worth less than the life of a European, but sadly, that's the measure thats being used here at ITN. So, all that I was trying to convey was: Even if you were to take that measure and given that (1) the European motor accident is regarded as notable (its posted now) and (2) a ferry sinking is more uncommon than a bus accident, this incident in Bangladesh should satisfy notability unless you are saying 1 European life is worth more than 5 Bangladeshi lives. I know its jarring that value of human lives are being compared like this, but its more jarring to hear that lives of people from your region does not even compare.

**Apparently not just ITN, as no one (including you) has seen fit to actually write an article about this event. Perhaps, instead of offering preemptive recriminations for not posting something because it involves "other" people, we could satisfy the ''fundamental requirement'' for posting, and then, y'know, see what happens? Instead, you annoyed many people who otherwise would agree with you. --[[User:Golbez|Golbez]] ([[User talk:Golbez|talk]]) 03:41, 15 March 2012 (UTC)
*** Fair point. I have my own reasons/limitations preventing me from contributing to the article right now. Its not uncommon for the nomination to be made and then for interested editors to step in update the article and I just wanted to establish notability while making the nomination. But I agree with you that my comment would perhaps have carried more weight if backed by some contribution.

*'''Support''' This is huge. Britannica was one of those rare printed works that thrived across both the UK and American English markets. It may mean little to younger editors here, but I suspect it was a big thing for older editors. The print version also utilised the door-to-door sales model in a fairly aggressive way. For it to disappear is one of those notable moments in history. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 01:12, 14 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Strong oppose''' I agree with FormerIP: if we were not ourselves an encyclopeadic project we wouldn't even be considering it.  How many other publications of similar standing have gone out of print or gone online-only?  The nearest comparison I can think of would be the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' which wasn't even nominated when it made a similar announcment back in 2010.  If anything that is ''more'' authoritative within its subject domain than Britannica ever was.  Would it have stood a chance if it had been nominated?  I very much doubt it.

Looking at this incident in the wider context, it is a very historic announcement, another step from "old" to "new" in the way an incredibly important product is made available. The symbolism alone is worthy of attention. I can see exactly why people are nervous about highlighting the news on the front page - but let us be clear, Wiki has been around for years, it's not as though we can gloat about this development.

*Look, I hate to say it, but the Israeli-Gaza conflict has been somewhat of an ongoing murmur over the past year, or even past few years. There's no "wow factor" here.

<s>*'''Oppose''': </s> '''Support''': US-led military action has killed [[Civilian casualties in the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|9,415 (low estimate) - 29,007 (high estimate) civilians]] since the war began (out of a total of 17,611 - 37,208 deaths due to insurgent+US-led+unattributed actions). This figure is for Afghanistan alone and also excludes 2012 kills. 16 Afghan civilian lives dont make that much of an impact on those numbers. Will concede that there is an increased notability since the soldier went rogue and got 15/16 kills and given the context of the Quran burnings, but IMO, still not notable enough given how routine civilian casualties caused by US/coalition forces have been during the course of the war. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 18:15, 11 March 2012 (UTC)
::I agree in many ways, this event should be no more notable than the daily deaths of the, accumulated, ~ 1million who died due to the American wars over the last decade. But the problem is not that this event is being seen too high, it is that the other events are being seen as too low of importance. I would love to see the month's death count of ongoing wars be posted at the end of each month. Also this event of mass murder does have higher significance than the other killings by invading forces in that the attack wasn't even trying to go after militant or a mistake, but a cold blooded massacre of civilians in their beds. The high potential for violent protests arising fromt his event also adds to its notability. [[User:Canadian Spring|Canadian Spring]] ([[User talk:Canadian Spring|talk]]) 22:03, 11 March 2012 (UTC)
::: '''Changing to Support''': Sorry, I seemed to have underestimated the impact. The US is actually preparing for retaliation from the Afghans. Its splashed all over the news (on TV and even in unconnected regional language newspapers). Pleasantly surprised to see people caring about Afghan deaths. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 05:40, 12 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - As  CH and SP suggest above, one soldier suffering a breakdown and going on a shooting spree isn't that major of an event in the grand scheme of violence in Afghanistan. Just since the recent Quran burning, ''dozens'' of protestors have been killed, police have been massacred while they slept and ISAF troops have been killed by apparent allies. If there ''are'' international consequences of some sort as a result of this incident, we should post them by all means, but supporting because we ''predict'' such things is not a good idea.

*'''Conditional support''' You cannot just compare numbers and say this is nothing related to the total amount of deaths since the start of the War in Afghanistan. So far we all now that the US-led military actions do not tend to kill civilians and this is something that clearly shows the opposite. Even if the soldier did not get an order to massacre the locals and was led by his own mind, it impels negative reactions on international level that are of very big importance. I support a blurb that makes a distinction apart of the other actions in Afghanistan and documenting the significant international reactions condemning this act.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 19:12, 11 March 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''' - In my view, the massacre is notable on its own right. But apart from that, it has, as recognized by press commenters, the potential to spark fresh waves of hostility between Afghans and NATO, considering the mood prevailing in the country. This can have consequences on NATO withdrawing, and even have an impact on national opinion regarding further military involvement in the region.

*'''Support''' Death during top level international competition in a major world sport: comparable to [[Wouter Weylandt]] and (sorry I can't remember his name: motor-cycle racer in latter part of 2011: maybe someone will edit my post to add his name, no disrespect to deceased intended), both of which were posted.  [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 09:45, 11 March 2012 (UTC)
**You're thinking of [[Dan Wheldon]] in IndyCar or [[Marco Simoncelli]] in MotoGP, probably. However we do have a more recent precedent, and from the same class of sport (skiing), in Sarah Burke who we didn't post. [[User:Strange Passerby|Strange Passerby]] ([[User talk:Strange Passerby|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Strange Passerby|cont]]) 11:53, 11 March 2012 (UTC)
:::I was thinking of Simoncelli, but of course I should have included Wheldon as well.  As already stated, the key difference between these and Burke is the issue of death in competition, rather than in training. [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 14:38, 11 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Reluctant oppose'''. Whether we post is a (somewhat subjective) weighing up of how well covered the sport is, how significant the event was, how prominent the individual was, and how widely covered the death is. [[Nodar Kumaritashvili]]'s posting demonstrates that this works fairly well, even where the death doesn't hit all of these points. The posting of Weylandt was in my opinion an anomaly: the blurb went out of its way to point out the rarity, which suggests that even the nominator didn't consider the death alone to obviously meet ITN thesholds. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  13:39, 11 March 2012 (UTC)
:::I would have thought it not at all surprising that things that are rare are more likely to be newsworthy. A soldier dying in the pursuit of his profession is less newsworthy than a sportsperson doing so, precisely because the latter is less expected.

Regardless of whether it was the largest ever, it was a major event that garnered lots of international media coverage.

:::I removed the not-so-terse, jargony tail.  In English, it's an important result because it may help us (soon) understand why there's more matter than antimatter in the universe.  Unfortunately the mainstream press doesn't know their elbows from their other body parts when it comes to what's exciting news in particle physics.  It also doesn't help the English-language media that this experiment is in China.  The announcement is a bit fresh, too quick for some of the sources.  Articles are starting to show up in Google News science section[http://news.google.com/news/more?hl=en&safe=off&gl=us&q=daya+bay+neutrino&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1188&bih=585&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ncl=dHK_VtllDxX1VJM7mPhb0c64B-oKM&ei=BxtZT-7AEeWiiQKq9uGDCw&sa=X&oi=news_result&ct=more-results&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQqgIwAA].  I think, for example, Scientific American[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=daya-bay-neutrinos] counts as mainstream for you.  It's showing up as a Xinhua headline[http://www.chinaview.cn/] (headline no. 2) right now[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-03/08/c_131455034.htm].

:::::The difference is that the Daya Bay result is a >5σ result, aka a "discovery" for a physicist.  The OPERA result appeared in the Wikipedia news because it had reached the 5σ standard for discovery even though it later turned out to be a possible uncontrolled systematic error.  To contrast, the Higgs boson has not been discovered and therefore does not (yet?) belong as a headline.  The result to which you point, the first low signal-to-noise attempt at observing the antihydrogen hyperfine spectral lines, is interesting and an useful step in technological progress but not a discovery.  You would need something like >5σ detection that the antihydrogen spectral lines differ from the hydrogen spectral lines for it to be worth headlining.  It's easy for the BBC to pick up those stories because the research is at CERN in Geneva, not Guangdong province.  Don't get me wrong; I do anticipate exciting results and maybe even "discoveries" from some of the antihydrogen/positronium experiments in the coming years.

*As a physicist, I find this cool, but I wouldn't really expect to see it on ITN.  [[Neutrinos]] are the tiny nearly-massless particles that can pass through ordinary matter very easily.  There are three types of neutrino (electron, muon, and tau).  As it turns out they all have slightly different masses.  More significantly, under the right conditions a neutrino of one type (say an electron neutrino) can turn into a neutrino of a different type (say a muon neutrino).  The model that explains how neutrinos of one type turn into neutrinos of other types has several free parameters that have to be determined experimentally.  The experiment being discussed here, produced by a collaboration of 240 physicists working in China, has finally measured the last of these parameters.  So now it can be said that we have a plausibly complete understanding of [[neutrino oscillation]]s.  This is important because the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics originally assumed all neutrinos were massless and no oscillations occurred.  So, this expands our understanding of particle physics and opens the door for experiments that may help explain why there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe (i.e. [[CP-violation]]).  It is cool stuff, but I'm not sure I'd expect to see a lot news coverage here.  In terms of science stories, the discovery that neutrinos aren't massless was a much bigger deal.  This is more about finally filling in the details of how neutrinos behave.  [[User:Dragons flight|Dragons flight]] ([[User talk:Dragons flight|talk]]) 21:11, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

So, the product has been announced. What is the bottomline? Is it just a new version of the iPad with better resolution display and better camera or is it something completely new and revolutionary?

:I personally think it's pointless for us to debate the relative significance of the Ipad upgrade.  It's doubtlessly highly subjective and will get us mired in pointless debate.  The key question is, is it new of interest to our readers and is there a decent article update.  But let's also bear in mind that the Ipad has a cultural significance that goes beyond it's technical specifications.  --[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 16:55, 8 March 2012 (UTC)
*Since I started the supports, I suppose it behooves me to add a brief note in this break, enhancing my reasoning. This generation of the iPad appears to me to be the one that pushes this technology beyond a novelty to a working tool. But it is not just my own feeling... the LA Times article I cite is titled "Apple's new iPad takes aim at the PC" and I think that is the reasoned opinion of a lot of sober thinking on the newspaper's staff. Read the article... after the statement "In unveiling the upgraded iPad on Wednesday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook repeated the theme that the difference between PCs and tablets would soon vanish, and that the iPad was the "poster child for the post-PC world," the Times notes the opinions of technology analyists. "The iPad is encroaching more and more on the kinds of tasks that we've historically associated with PCs," said Ross Rubin, an analyst at NPD Group." In other words, traditional desktop and even laptop computers are now clearly on the way out. We are witnessing a revolution, and I suppose I should add that I have never owned an Apple Computer or iPad but for the first time am considering it. To get to the point: I believe that this is an item of news for ITN that is of broad interest to Main Page readers, which is why I stuck my neck out to support in the face of a mass of opposes. I respect opinions to the contrary, but I strongly feel they are wrong.

*'''Oppose'''. per [[WP:CRYSTAL]] and [[WP:SPAM]].  Wikipedia is not a promotional vehicle, and frankly, there is nothing remotely special about Apple releasing an update to an existing product that warrants appearance on ITN.  This is not ITN-worthy news any more than the fact that people used to line up around the block to get a [[World of Warcraft]] expansion or that people go stupid over Black Friday or Boxing Day sales. Nor does someone's personal opinion on what might happen in the future, possibly, make this any more important. [[User:Resolute|Reso]][[User Talk:Resolute|lute]] 18:16, 8 March 2012 (UTC)

*'''Strong Oppose''' John by your rationale we should post basically every Apple conference since the ipad upgrade is not the point here... The media frenzy is only there due to their stock price.

*'''Comment''': In my view, this reflects the [[Wikipedia:Systemic bias|systemic bias]] existing in Wikipedia. Admittedly, an average Wikipedia reader would be interested in the iPad3 release, just like the average Wikipedia reader (including myself) would be more interested in reading the article on [[Mass Effect 3]] than the [[Ba Chuc Massacre]] (the size and quality of the both articles are a testimony to that). I'm not saying that hard work put in by those passionate about ME3 should be ignored or that anyone should be forced to update the Ba Chuc article. But when assessing notability, lets keep a broader perspective - while a large part of Wikipedia users (apple fanbois, consoletards and pc elitists included) would be interested in the iPad3 release, it does not really fit the "notability" bill in a broader international context. As the article on systemic bias itself identifies, since the average Wikipedian user will be an English-speaking, technically inclined, male from a developed country, it will never be able to erase systemic bias. But lets try. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 05:28, 9 March 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' I opposed right at the start, and to be fair to Jusdafax, I oppose now even more! "We are witnessing a revolution" is simply false. We're witnessing a release of a slightly improved bit of kit. It's not more a revolution than the newest kind of flatscreen TV or improved microwave. As Ashishg has pointed out, this is media frenzy over a press release, not a news story. In broad terms, it's not actually that notable - Apple releasing a new product would only be notable were that product different from the last in a manner incomprehensible to us now. And as ChocolateHorlicks says, there is a bias within Wikipedia which will always mean technology articles and "now" events will always seem vastly more important than historic ones. I'd prefer people spent effort on parliamentary constituencies over Pokemon, but that's the cards we're dealt. I understand that Apple addicts are minded to think that we're on the cusp of some new bright future, but the reality is very different. This new iPad is just another small step along a very, very well worn path. It's not news. It's not notable. It's just an upgraded bit of kit.

*'''Tentatively support removal''' Although new news about Syria is being reported, the article currently in the sticky [[2011–2012 Syrian uprising]] is not receiving consistent enough content updates to the article for me to oppose removal [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2011%E2%80%932012_Syrian_uprising&action=history]. Generally, I would support keeping some sort of sticky in ITN, but if the article is not being continually updated (something that a sticky needs to have), then I don't think the sticky should stay.

*'''Support removal''' - The conflict and news coverage of it is, of course, far from over; however, ITN is not and should not imitate a 24-hour news ticker.

*'''Support''' Breitpart played a major role in internet politics and was a leading american conservative. [http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/01/politics/breitbart-obit/index.html link], [http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/editor-of-breitbart-com-says-andrew-breitbart-has-died/ link], [http://www.suntimes.com/news/10981830-418/media-publisher-activist-andrew-breitbart-has-died-at-age-43.html link]. if he died of old age then maybe not but this was a premature death and has generated responses of american presidential candidates. This isn't a strong support, but it's been a slow week.

**There's a tendency to overaggrandize a person's importance in their obits and post-death analysis.  I live in the U.S. and follow the news and politics, and barely knew who Breitbart was before his death.  I was vaguely aware of him and knew who he was, of course, but only as one of the endless "talking heads" and pundits that appear on various cable news and radio talk shows.  Sure, he was a public figure, but I don't think he ''particularly'' seperated himself from the pack, as it were, so I don't think his death rises to that of the level we'd normally expect of ITN.  If someone like Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh were in this situation, I think it'd be a no-brainer support, but Breitbart simply doesn't rise to that level.  It is sad that he has died, but there are many sad deaths of public figures every day.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 20:08, 1 March 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''' "I live in the U.S. and follow the news and politics, and barely knew who Breitbart was before his death." Doesn't matter. What you knew is not the threshold for inclusion. the reality is breitbart was an important figure in internet politics (even leading a campaign to unseat a congressman) and sources say that. ITN is not about what editors think. [[User:Wikifan12345|<span style="color:#6E6D6D">Wikifan</span>]]<sup><small>[[User_talk:Wikifan12345|Be nice]]</small></sup>  20:41, 1 March 2012 (UTC)
**Yes, you are correct about that.  Which is why what you think is '''also''' not the threshold for inclusion.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 20:49, 1 March 2012 (UTC)

****Well, the sources still need to be evaluated by other editors against their interpretation of the ITN criteria.  Which is what I and others have done.  Providing sources and reciting what they say does not yet, as far as I am aware, result in something being instantly posted at [[WP:ITN]].  Instead, there is a discussion over the merits of the sources, and over the merits of the suggestion.  So far, I have given my interpretations, as have you.  Thankfully, other people will be by shortly, and indeed some have before you even posted, to give their interpretations, so we don't have to rely on merely the two of us.  You see, this is how Wikipedia works.  We don't purely rely on my word, or on your word.  Other people get to give their perspective as well!  Isn't that great!  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 21:58, 1 March 2012 (UTC)
*****The problem is editors didn't even recognize the sources. They rejected the ITN candidate whole-sale. All the opposes here are weak at best.
