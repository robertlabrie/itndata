*'''Strong Oppose'''- I don't feel that any donation to a museum should ever be posted on ITN. [[User:Bzweebl|<font color="#D60047">B</font><font color="#F0A000">zw</font><font color="#00A300">ee</font><font color="#0A47FF">bl</font>]]  ([[User talk:Bzweebl|talk]]) 02:03, 2 May 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose, and Comment''' You say that this is "last battleship left anywhere on the face of the earth that isn't in line to be scrapped or sunk", but aren't there other battlerships still in existence that are museum ships already? [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)]] seems to be such an example; [[USS Missouri (BB-63)]] is another one... So [[USS Iowa (BB-61)]] is simply a further battleship that becomes a museum ship (ok, the last one which isn't already one), and not the last battleship on earth. [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 19:27, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
:*What he means is that the ships you are referring to have already been donated. Therefore, the only battleship left anywhere on earth that hasn't been donated is the Iowa, and the Iowa was just donated, so its a milestone for this particular type of ship since there are no more battleships to donate for use as museums or memorials, or alternatively, to scrap or sink.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/70.238.127.216|70.238.127.216]] ([[User talk:70.238.127.216|talk]]) 21:57, 2 May 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''Oppose'''- I don't think that we should post this until construction is finished and it is officially opened. Otherwise, the only newsworthy thing that happened was that it became the tallest building in its own city. However, I would like to note that this is indeed a minority topic. <ins>That has now been reflected in the nom.</ins> [[User:Bzweebl|<font color="#D60047">B</font><font color="#F0A000">zw</font><font color="#00A300">ee</font><font color="#0A47FF">bl</font>]]  ([[User talk:Bzweebl|talk]]) 00:14, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' (history aside) what is significant about being the tallest building in a given city ? wait until it opens when it will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere (assuming that it is when it opens). [[User:Mtking|<span style="color:Green;text-shadow:lightgreen 0.110em 0.110em 0.110em;">Mt</span>]][[User talk:Mtking|<span style="color:gold;">king</span>]]<sup>[[Special:Contributions/Mtking|<font color="gold"> (edits) </font>]]</sup> 00:33, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' - Interesting and significant symbol of an event that changed the modern world forever. Article update is in the construction section and could be expanded. Article is in great shape, however. I feel this is an excellent item for ITN. [[User:Jusdafax|<font color="green">Jus</font>]][[User talk:Jusdafax|<font color="C1118C">da</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Jusdafax|<font color="#0000FF">fax</font>]]  00:36, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. My reasoning is the same as Bzweebl and Mtking; the building has simply become the tallest in a given city, which isn't much of an achievement. [[User:Grapple X|<span style="color:#556655"><small>'''GRAPPLE'''</small></span>]] [[User talk:Grapple X|<span style="color:#556655"><small>'''X'''</small></span>]] 00:39, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' as per the comments above. Reconsider when it has reached its final height. [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 00:48, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' I would definitely support posting this once it's completed, but until its doors open I don't think it should be posted yet. -- [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|cont]]) 02:23, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
**'''Oppose''' I concur w/ Mtking, IF it's the tallest in the Western Hemishpere as the builders purport when it opens then we should include it. [[User:Rhodesisland|Rhodesisland]] ([[User talk:Rhodesisland|talk]]) 04:13, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Until it's completed, this isn't the tallest building in New York, or anywhere else for that matter. It may be the tallest structure in the city, but it's not the tallest building. Also, calling it the tallest in the Western Hemisphere when completed will need a bit of qualification. Its roof will still be lower than the <s>Sears</s> Willis Tower's; only because on One World Trade Center's ginormous, disproportionate, somewhat architecturally significant spire will it be considered taller than that. That, of course, doesn't mean it won't be significant. It probably should/would go up anyway, simply because it's the new World Trade Center flagship building, no matter how tall it is. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 04:24, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' I have sympathy with the nomination but ultimately this is a curiosity for DYK or similar. When it's finished, a nomination this way comes. Right now it's significant in a way which does't quite fit ITN [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 04:48, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - The completion of this building will be both culturally and architecturally significant, but that hasn't happened yet. [[User:AlexTiefling|AlexTiefling]] ([[User talk:AlexTiefling|talk]]) 09:51, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Question''' - Just curious as to when new buildings are usually posted to ITN: topping out, completion, or open for business? --[[User:Bongwarrior|Bongwarrior]] ([[User talk:Bongwarrior|talk]]) 19:02, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
::New buildings normally are not included on ITN unless they represent some type of record (height, overall space, etc.). We posted the Burj Khalifa twice; once when it surpassed the CN Tower in height and again when it opened (I think). I don't know whether being the tallest building in a single city would be notable enough for ITN. --[[User:Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF0000">Plasma</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF4500">Twa</font>]][[User talk:Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF0000">2</font>]] 07:42, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' A bit of advice for next time. I would support an ITN posting for when the building <u>opens</u>, because I am in no doubt that the coverage will justify it. But that support would actually be conditional on ''not'' mentioning it being the biggest building in New York. My rationale is twofold. One, we would not ordinarily post a blurb for the tallest building in New York, and to do so might create a precident we later regret when we reject similar nominations from other massive cities. Two, to post a blurb with emphasis on the building's height might detract from the fact that the building's opening will be considered ITN-worthy in its own right. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  13:56, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
**I concur with WFC. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Muboshgu|Muboshgu]] ([[User talk:Muboshgu#top|talk]]) 14:03, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
***Well, I doubt I'll be the person nominating it next time anyway; I imagine I'll leave it to another. But for discussion's sake, even if we were to post similar items each time a new "tallest building" opens in one of the world's, say, 10 largest cities, glancing at the history of NYC, Tokyo, etc., suggests that these records turn over in those cities every 10-20 years or so; 10 items over 15 years would hardly be a flood, and given the minority topic, could actually be helpful.  [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 14:26, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
****You make a very good general point there actually (although I stand by my view in this specific instance, due to how certain I am that the building will be considered notable enough). I don't seek to undermine the principle you suggest, but according to [[World's largest cities]], if we went by top 10 cities by population we would be excluding the likes of Moscow, Beijing, London and Paris. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  14:49, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
*****Is it really necessary to define a fixed rule for this? If new tall buildings are opened anywhere, editors are free to suggest here to highlight them at ITN, and the community can decide on a case-by-case basis. I fear we may else be opening a can of worms. Would we only highlight buildings? Why not tall towers (such as the [[Tokyo Sky Tree]] and the [[Canton Tower]])? Why not flagpoles (e.g. [[Baku]] and [[Dushanbe]] have reached new world records last year)? [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 17:48, 2 May 2012 (UTC)
******I agree that a case-by-case basis is best (and am fine with waiting for the official opening, of course); I'm just making the case that these shouldn't be automatically excluded. A new tallest building in New York or Tokyo to me is interesting geographical/technical news because there have been so few; reviewing this closer, however, it looks like Mumbai's record changed hands seven times in the last few years, making it far less remarkable if it turned over again. I'm less worried about the [[slippery slope]] concerns, though; the reason that's generally considered a logical fallacy is that there's nothing we could ever post that someone couldn't respond "but doesn't that mean we need to include every ''X'' ever?" A reasonable precedent (a building in a top-10 city, a long-standing record) would still allow us to determine a cut-off point down the road in the unlikely scenario that these articles come to dominate ITN. If the flagpole record has been broken twice in a year, for example, it doesn't seem very newsworthy. In NYC's case, on the other hand, this would only be the third structure since 1931 to surpass the Empire State Building.

*'''Oppose'''. The top three is the same as last year and only two of the top ten were not in the top ten last year, which sort of means it fails to put the "new" into "news", IMO. [[User:FormerIP|Formerip]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 23:41, 30 April 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support'''- Food and drink is rarely, if ever, posted on ITN, and gastronomy is the most current aspect of that major topic. This story also represents the continued rise of [[New Nordic cuisine]] which is a significant newsworthy aspect of it. Also, I updated both articles, so they should both be bold in the blurb.

*'''Oppose: (1):''' This is a list published by a private magazine called [[Restaurant (magazine)|Restaurant]].

'''(2):''' The magazine is only about fine dining and this is only a list of luxury restaurants. '''(3):''' The magazine's wikipedia article itself says (and backed up by a source) that "The list is reported in the press, but is not universally accepted or considered as definitive".

*'''Comment''' The fact that it appears in a commercial publication is neither here nor there. ITN covers the Academy Awards, BAFTAs and Grammys who are in effect private trade bodies. The scope of the vote, nearly 6000 industry professionals adds weight to it's importance. FWIW I'd be happy to see a best computer games award on ITN if the judging panel was as robust and wide ranging.

Actually, even if you check the reviews of the top Japanese and Singaporean restaurants on the list, it is highlighted that eg. the cook has excelled in fusing Japanese cuisine with Western technique (examples here: [http://www.theworlds50best.com/awards/1-50-winners/iggys/ Iggys in Singapore]; [http://www.theworlds50best.com/awards/1-50-winners/les-creations-de-narisawa/ Narisawa in Tokyo]). Indeed, for 2013, they even plan to have a separate Top 50 Asian Cuisine list ([http://www.theworlds50best.com/asia/ Asia's Top 50])... I'm not saying this invalidates the list per se - after all, the Oscars are also biased towards American films - but we should be aware that this magazine's experts seem to prefer a certain (Western) style of cooking...

*'''Oppose'''.  This just seems too trivial.  I dont' see any evidence that this award has anywhere near the prestige or the notibility of the Oscars, the Grammies, the Palme d'Or, etc, even if it is arguably the most prestigious restaurant ranking available.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 10:45, 3 May 2012 (UTC)

:: Population decline is a continuous process, so you wouldn't expect it to appear in the news per se. The status is not local, but national - the Federal Environment minister has classified the koala populations in those 3 states (though not in Victoria or S Australia) as vulnerable. Given that koalas only live in Australia, this basically means that they are considered vulnerable in a major part of their habitat.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but the core fact that the organism is genetically distinct from the five existing kingdoms of eukaryote doesn't appear to be speculative, but from a peer-reviewed journal.

:::You raise a good point, but as a non-biologist I'm not sure what "officially" would necessarily mean in this context. Is there a particular body or publication whose recognition would make this 100% official (in the way that Pluto was officially stripped of planet status)? My guess (and only a guess) is that there isn't--that a consensus will gradually emerge that this is indeed a new kingdom, without any formal moment of total recognition. For that reason I feel like this initial publication, in a [[Molecular Biology and Evolution|top journal in the field]], is the most surprising and newsworthy moment.

[[User:EdwardLane|EdwardLane]] ([[User talk:EdwardLane|talk]]) 10:51, 3 May 2012 (UTC)
:*Over the years it has been placed in various classifications and Protista is just a grab bag for all those single cell eucaryots.

Although the current story is from researchers who got their specimen from there, Collodictyon is also found in other places in Europe and Asia. [[User:Graeme Bartlett|Graeme Bartlett]] ([[User talk:Graeme Bartlett|talk]]) 11:32, 3 May 2012 (UTC)
::*Fair enough about the grab bag, but it seems like the blurb and the article still need attention. I'd remove the norway lake section from the blurb I think.

:::'''Comment''' In disagreement with EdwardLane's "not ready", that our article lists the biont as a "'''protist*'''" (note the apostrophe) has nothing to do with the fact that a peer-reviewed article has declared the organism to be a eukarote lying outside any known eukaryote kingdom.  Indeed, "protista" is just a grab bag term like invertebrate, no longer used seriously by biologists.  Given that no new kingdom name has been provided for this organism, it is okay that ''our article'' resorts to an asterisked placeholder.  But we cannot refer to our article as a reference 'showing' that the creature belongs to the defunct protist category.  What matters here is the fact that the gene sequencing claims showing it is a eukaryote outlier are peer reviewed and uncontested.  I only have a bachelor's in Biology, but you can take my opinion as educated in this matter until some higher authority contradicts me.

:::'''Neutral'''. While I'm interested in this one, after taking a closer look, I'm more hesitant now for a few reasons. First is that the world record hasn't been independently confirmed, but is just based on a press release of the research institute that owns the ship. Second is that the article doesn't have much of an update, and looking at the news coverage, it might be difficult to give it one; most news sources seem to simply quote the press release. Is it possible to find some third-party comment on this achievement, its significance, etc.? I've added two sentences about the IODP's claim and the previous record-holder for now.

Also, it seems unclear how deep within the soil Chikyu has actually drilled - it states that it reached 7740 meters below sea level - but e.g. the Mariana Trench is 10 km deep at its deepest (so if you hypothetically managed for your drill to touch down on the lowest point of the Mariana Trench and then scratched the surface for 1 meter, would you have the new world record at sea drilling?).

*'''Support''' - The significance of this is not that the death penalty was abolished in one U.S. state -- it's that it is now abolished in one-third of the 50 U.S. states. In past cases in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on whether a particular form of punishment is "cruel and unusual" (and thus barred by the U.S. Constitution), an important factor in the decision was the fraction of U.S. jurisdictions that had abolished the particular form of punishment. Some U.S. states will never independently decide to eliminate capital punishment, but the one-third-of-the-states threshold may prove to be significant in inducing the Supreme Court to do it for them. --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 14:39, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

****Have you noticed comments about the international attention? The non-American '''Supports''' aren't really about the law in just one little state.

******Claiming this is newsworthy because it is an example of the US's move away from the death penalty could be seen as a violation of [[WP:CRYSTAL]]. I would argue that the abolsihment of the death penalty in California or Texas would be news simply given the prevalance of the death penalty in those states, but saying that a tiny state's decision to get rid of it is notable because it is symbolic of the entire country's movement away from it is absurd, especially when states 8-10 times the population still have the penalty. --[[User:Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF0000">Plasma</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF4500">Twa</font>]][[User talk:Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF0000">2</font>]] 21:41, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

It has even received coverage on the [http://www.economist.com/node/18010841 Economist] 2. The election demonstrated the inaccuracy of election polls perhaps unlike any other (see the Calgary Herald article). Never has an election with such consistent poll numbers for one party resulted in such a decisive victory for another party. 3. If someone accuses this article of regional bias, I will say that I would happily nominate the Uttar Pradesh elections from February.

::::I think Grapple would be in a minority in expecting to see the results of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections being posted (there is no "general election" to speak of), and I would venture to suggest that he writes out of a lack of constitutional awareness: the NIA elections in 2011 were, as far as I remember, not even nominated.  If we posted either the 2011 Welsh Assembly election, or 2011 Scottish general election results, it certainly wasn't noted on their talk pages, and I don't believe that it did happen.  Of course, even if it did, it would have no direct affect on this nomination, as ITN does not have a system of authority of precedent, and they would have needed to have been argued on the basis of exceptional impact and news coverage.

::It's been in the pipeline for several years: new plant can't be built overnight, and it takes time to develop processes to the point they are a commercial practicality.  If this particular shrinking was somehow breaking into the unknown the time to post would have been a couple of years ago when the first experimental samples were available, or a year before that when prototype stepper optics had advanced to the point it became a possibility.  By the time cutting-edge semiconductor developments are productised they are no longer cutting edge.  Intel and AMD both work on two shrinks simultaneously: they are already working on the next shrink ''and'' the one after that.  Ultimately this is not some huge breakthough, essentially all this is is an ongoing shrink whose only practical significance is slightly more megahertz per watt of the kind that has been going on since well before the 4004 was released in 1971.

*'''Oppose''' I don't see this as being significant enough. I don't feel as though you can consider a new model of a consumer-end CPU to be a significant achievement, when it only offers a 5-15% increase in performance over the previous generation. In fact, gains like this should be expected when a new generation of processor is released, especially seeing as how [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] churn out a new generation of processors every 8-12 months or so. Had this been drastically different than the previous generation in terms of features and benefits, I would then consider it to be worthy. It's the same thing with new cars: you usually don't see that much improvement in a years time to call it significantly different over the previous model. To me, this is exactly why we don't post things like the [[iPad 3]] and other consumer-end electronics/technology products: where is the significant improvement, and where is its real-world impact? -- [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|cont]]) 03:38, 24 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Posted''' This is not overwhelming consensus. By some accounts, this probably isn't consensus, but the timer is flaming red and while the aims of the countering systematic bias crowd may be altruistic, they are misplaced. While this has existed at ITN for years, there seems to be a feeling among editors here that there are events we "do post" and those we "don't post". Stories featured prominently in the media are not posted because we they're derided as "tabloid fodder" or "yet another sports story" while stories that make headlines in very few places (e.g. elections in very small countries) are posted because those are stories we "do post". In either category, the "if it didn't happen in White-Majority Country X, we would/wouldn't be posting this" argument lurks in the background. Look. People have adequately demonstrated that this is in the news across a wide area. The article is well-updated. That's enough.

*'''Oppose''' for several reasons. Even if we consider the last post from 2009, it seems the only one before the next two fail to be posted, so to keep neutrality over the importance of this accomplishment there must be an explanation that states why this perfect game is more significant than the previous two. Furthermore, Humber's perfect game occurs as fourth in 3 years which does not tend to be rare as we have records and accomplishments that were standing for many years. Lastly, the article is in very bad shape and needs substantial improvement to get sufficient quality.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 00:07, 22 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''—my reasoning is simply that this is the twenty-first perfect game, not the first. I've supported first-time sporting achievements before, and will continue to do so again, but another occurrence of something that has happened twenty times before isn't really that much of a landmark. A great personal achievement, sure, but not breaking news.

*'''Support'''-Quite simply, in over a century of professional baseball, only 21 perfect games have been thown. Over 2,000 games are played ''every season'' in the modern era, making this an extremely rare feat. Major League baseball is popular in both North and South America, and also enjoys a large following in Japan. Hence a rare event with a large audience throughout several areas of the world deserves to have such event reported. <span style="font-size:smaller;font-family:'arial bold',sans-serif;border:1px solid Black;">[[User:N419BH|<span style="color:Black;background:#FFD700;">N419</span>]][[User talk:N419BH|<span style="background:Black;color:#FFD700;">BH</span>]]</span> 00:15, 22 April 2012 (UTC)

*{{ec}}'''Oppose''' Newsworthy, yes, but this has been done twenty times before, a read of the linked article shows that there are no firsts to this (''third perfect game in White Sox history'', ''the 18th no-hitter in White Sox history'', ''second fewest starts prior to throwing a perfect game'') except it was the guys ''first career complete game'', if he does it again in todays game then come back as that would be significant.

*'''Support''' - The achievement is rare (143 years of baseball/21 perfect games = one every 6.8 years on average), but more importantly it is the ultimate achievement in the sport.  If you want to look at it that way, the achievement "ties" the record for best game, since it is literally impossible to do better than a perfect game.  For comparison, the Men's 100 meter record has been broken 20 times since 1910, so in terms of frequency a perfect game is about as common as 100m record. (And indeed MLB games are more common than sprints by top level competition, so it that respect a perfect game/game played is rarer than a world record/100m race contested).  Sure it *could* happen again tomorrow, but that is an exceptionally dumb reason to oppose; another airplane could crash and kill 100, but that, of course is not a reason to avoid posting [[Bhoja Air Flight 213]].   --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 00:27, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
*:When calculating a frequency of something to happen in recent times it is usual to omit the periods with large discrepancy to get to a more precise result. Perhaps it used to be a very rare and special achievement in the past or some periods, but definitely the time gap is shortening too much. If we calculate for last 10 perfect games in 24 years, it would yield to 2.4 years per game; if last 5 in 8 years, then 1.6 years per game. Following this progression it's obvious that a perfect game is something that becomes more common.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 01:00, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
*::It is generally not a good idea to draw conclusions from a small sample.  If you look at the entire history of perfect games, you'll see they are randomly sprinkled throughout.  For example, the first two both occurred in 1880.  There is no reason to think the feat is any easier today, than in the past.  (However, more games are played per year now than in the past. So, naturally there will be somewhat more perfect games now; maybe one every 3-4 years on average.  Whether its once evry 6-7 years or 3-4 years, makes very little difference to my argument.) --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 01:11, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
*:::We reached the conclusion here. As many games are played that raises the probability for a perfect games, but it also makes not a rare event. Apparently it's something very important in this sport, but it's still not that much even if you claim in the past it wasn't something common. But if it were a perfect game after a long years period, as it happened in 2009, I would probably have a different opinion about this.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 10:19, 22 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - I like baseball and I understand the significance of a perfect game, but it's an individual accomplishment that has been done before.

*'''Oppose''' The 21st of ANYTHING like this is, by its very nature, not notable. This is a record insofar as someone has retained some kind of stats burst on the back of a cigarette packet, but important enough for the front page here it most certainly is not. "The 21st most something in a sport" is not considered important in any field that I can think of. As much as certain sports like their stats - cricket, for example - we should only accept nominations in this type when the very top/most is broken, and even then only after serious consideration. Baseball is always 50/50 here anyway; baseball's twenty first most something arbitrary statistic? No chance.

*'''Oppose''' this is coming from an editor that specializes in baseball history. While pitching a perfect game is extremely notable (several books been written just on the subject), recently there beem 4 perfect games in the past four years, plus another one which would have been a perfect game if the umpire didn't blown the call, so it's not becoming as rare of a feat anymore. Out of those four years, the year that there was no perfect games i think something like 6 no-hitters happened that season. I'll only support a baseball ITN posting if a highly notable and influential player that advanced the progress of the sport dies ([[Stan Musial]], [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Hank Aaron]], [[Willie Mays]], maybe [[Marvin Miller]]), or if someone breaks a significant record like hitting five home runs in a game (never done) or hit over .400 in a season (last time done was in 1941), or the World Series and that's about it.

*:Again, its probably not a good idea to extrapolate forward on a data set of four.

*'''Comment''' It appears there is a lack of clarity about what has happened here, with the south claiming a withdrawal and the north claiming a forceful re-taking.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17787142]  We need to either establish what has happened more definitively or choose our words very carefully in any blurb.

::I know, thats why i said retakes control and not "Evict" or "wins battle" or "conceded" . Its NPOV to say they took back control as they had it first and they have write and its in intl borders of Sudan.[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 09:21, 21 April 2012 (UTC)   
*'''Oppose''' As stated above, and as I have mentioned before with Sudan/South Sudan, there is no one development which is notable enough to put on the front page.

::A sticky as an ongoing conflcit? Taking back the large and most contentious zone (for its oil capacity) seems like a big event.

*'''Support'''- This is a climax of an ongoing conflict. I feel like this nomination is being degraded just because it is surrounded by a near war that is also highly notable. If a major event is surrounded by events that are almost as major, the event should not be diminished.

That is very different from an admission that this individual lies outside one's cultural experience, with the reasonable implication that this will also be true for many others (essentially the response of Strange Passerby and WaltCip).  No amount of evidence of his fame within your sphere of experience invalidates the honesty of the admission of others, which you derided as implausible.  I stand by my charge of insularism.  Part of the problem lies in the proposer (possibly assuming that everyone shares his/her cultural experience) failing to present any rationale as to why they considered this individual to be worthy of posting at ITN, or to explain his importance.

It's one thing to convey unfamiliarity with a person (as other users have done) and quite another to assume that said individual is "unknown".  That's every bit as insular as Whenaxis's response.

I suppose that becoming accustomed to your culture, you assume that people know the same as you do, but obviously not. I'm not here to judge people's competency levels of the real world, I'm only here to provide my opinion. Though saying, "How in the world can you not know who this is?" is my own personal opinion and that people around in my country, Canada, knows who he is, or ought to know who he is, was just my opinion and does not constitute any valid reason for you to scrutinize me for saying so. I don't see you bombarding the others who merely stated their opinion with no valid evidence. There were several misconceptions coming into this argument for those who voted oppose.

He always been one of the biggest career boosters in music, getting [[Chuck Berry]], [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Janis Joplin]] to popular mainstream among others. He helped integrate it by using black artists performing their original songs back in the 50s instead of using white artists, [http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/obit/story/2012-04-18/dick-clark-dies-at-82/54390716/1 is an example of his impact].

He's credited with helping to popularize rock and roll (our [[Dick Clark]] article quotes Los Angeles Times writer Geoff Boucher as stating that "with the exception of Elvis Presley, Clark was considered by many to be the person most responsible for the bonfire spread of rock and roll across the country in the late 1950s") and to foster racial integration on American television.<br />He also hosted the most popular New Year's Eve TV program in the U.S. for decades, was among the best known American game show hosts, and produced such broadcasts as the American Music Awards (which he created), the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Golden Globe Awards.<br />The article has not yet been substantially updated, but numerous notable persons have publicly commented on Clark's death and legacy (so there's plenty of material with which to work).<br />Opposing the item is one thing, but comments along the lines of "Who?" and "Unknown." are patently ridiculous.  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 04:08, 19 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support'''.  I initally balked as I thought he was a celebrity mainly good for New Years TV specials and the like; I hadn't known of his history in the formative years of the Rock music industry.  I agree saying he's unknown is pretty unfair; he's obviously unknown to a lot of people but that's the case with many celebrities.  Bob Dylan is unknown to many people in the world too.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 14:36, 19 April 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Not a complete unknown internationally but ultimately fairly obscure outside of North America.  The blurb would need to do a ''lot'' more to explain who he is - he doesn't have universal name recognition by a long way.  However, my oppose is based primarily on the update: there has been a ''lot'' of editing activity to the article in the last 48 hours, but the actual update (as opposed to re-drafting) amounts to three sentences, two of which are reactions as opposed to covering the actual event. I may be moved to reconsider if that is developed in substance - there's clearly a lot of interest in this nom - but right now there simply isn't anything worth highlighting on the main page.

:::No, we have to take a balanced approach and consider the overall merits of the story.  Considering the quality of the update is a key thing to consider there - ITN is not intended as a news source but to highlight newly updated content.  Restricting discussion simply to notability is putting the cart before the horse.  If we didn't consider article and update quality there would be ''nothing at all'' to discuss for ITNR noms. This has now had two days, over twenty editors updating the article, and ~180 edits.  That is enough shakedown time in my view and the update is ''still'' insufficient.

It's common to ''note'' the issue (and express the opinion that an item shouldn't be posted until a better update emerges, as I did above), but the bold "support"/"oppose" comment is understood to refer to a hypothetical scenario in which the requisite update ''has'' occurred.

Dick Clark had a major impact on popular music, not just in America, but in Britain as well. Between the 1950s and 1970s, these two countries dominated 95% of popular music, and so something relevant to one of them has worldwide impact in this subject area. Dick Clark is an icon, not an American nobody. - '''[[User:Floydian|<font color="#5A5AC5">ʄɭoʏɗiaɲ</font>]]'''&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">τ</font>]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">¢</font>]]</sub> 17:27, 19 April 2012 (UTC)
::Dominated 95% of popular music in 15% or so of the world's regions? In the 1950s, the Soviet Russia and half of today's Europe were still strongly communist with no signs of weakness, God forbid someone bring America's capitalist media in, China followed suit. A very small percentage of Africa was even connected to the power grid, same can be said for South East Asia where numerous areas were still in war. Before oil dominated the United State's agenda, the Middle East had relatively little Western Influence despite military occupation in several countries there.  During this period of time, the only exception where a band actually had worldwide influence is The Beatles.

:::You're confusing popular music and music. Those countries didn't have popular music until very recently. I'd be surprised if many of them even had inspirational musicians that the country as a whole could recognize... And communism prohibits self-expression, so no music for you. Really, in conservative Britain and America, there was a great disdain against popular music like rock-and-roll (the movie Pirate Radio is nice historical recount of this atmosphere). Sex was breaking out into music, and the censors were working overtime. It was people like Dick Clark that brought these musicians to the bedrooms of the media-accessing world, against the wishes of the cultural elites. - '''[[User:Floydian|<font color="#5A5AC5">ʄɭoʏɗiaɲ</font>]]'''&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">τ</font>]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">¢</font>]]</sub> 19:02, 19 April 2012 (UTC)
::::Clark's contribution to the British music scene can easily be dismissed: the idea that he was a towering figure here is wide of the mark - he's a virtual unknown and what recognition he has is purely in an American context. And this position that Eastern Bloc countries were somehow lacking in the arts is probably more based on ignorance than reality: Andrei Tarkovsky comes to mind immediately as someone who was at the very top of his respective field (film in that case).

:::::Not at all. But likewise, I don't believe that being a mass-marketed Hollywood drone takes away from one's notability in any way (nor does it add). I don't believe he was a towering figure in Britain or even in Canada, but he was certainly well known and he had an enormous impact (Britain listens to American music too, no?) on popular music. I don't believe Eastern bloc countries had popular music. Few if any had a national chart or authority until the last 20 years. It's not ignorance to know that socialism and communism started by burning artefacts of popular culture - records, books, newspapers, magazines, artwork. Everything! That's how it is pushed onto cultures: by removing the identity of that culture and rewriting history in favour of communism/socialism. Liberal arts and individual opinions were suppressed.

*If this is not the correct place to discuss the broader issue, I apologize, but I've become frustrated at the continual debate about posting INT blurbs regarding "famous" peoples deaths and feel I need to pose a question to clarify my understanding of the "guidelines" or to make a point if my understanding is anywhere near correct.
:My understanding of the death criteria is that the person's death must ''meet at least one'' of the following criteria:
1.The deceased was in a high-ranking office of power and had a significant contribution/impact on the country/region.
2.The deceased was widely regarded as a very important figure in his or her field.

3.The death has a major international impact that affects current events....

The criteria does not say the person must meet ALL of them nor is any special emphasis placed on number three "international impact".
So why then is the international impact of the person the seemingly most important factor in most of the discussions about any particular posting?
The criteria would seem, at least to me, that if a person is significantly important in his/her home country and particular field, he/she would then meet two of the three criteria and should be posted irregardless to how he/she meets criteria three.

Am I missing an overriding criterium or discussion that has superceded the posted three Death Criteria? If so, we really should change the posted criteria. If not, than the overwhelming focus on international impact really should be curtailed and not permitted to veto a nomination.

Again, I apoligize if this is not the correct area to address this broader issue, perhaps the ITN Talk page would be better; but since the issue has arisen again in such force I was moved to ask. [[User:Rhodesisland|Rhodesisland]] ([[User talk:Rhodesisland|talk]]) 01:57, 20 April 2012 (UTC)
:*I think that the debate is about his international impact on the field. Nowhere in the criterion does it say the "in his/her home country," as you mentioned. His impact on the field cannot be limited by geography because then they are not "widely regarded" as an important figure. I hope that helps.

::But doesn't this part of criteria one, significant contribution/impact on ''the country/region'', imply his/her home country? What other country/region would we be talking about other than that person's home country?? Furthermore the "international aspect is specifically mentioned in criteria three, so wouldn't it be redundant if criteria one wasn't about the person's home country? And in addition, the criteria says that only ANY ONE of the three is neccessary; no one should be more important than the others or carry more weight.[[User:Rhodesisland|Rhodesisland]] ([[User talk:Rhodesisland|talk]]) 10:26, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

*My two cents is that, all of these problems over these 'controversial' posts would be solved if we were to give way to a 'stickies box' section where we simply post the names of subjects that may be in the news without having to go into details about blurbs and [[WP:DEADHORSE|repeated discussions]] over notability, significance, criteria and such. This would allow obviously notable (but heavily regional) events like the NCAA "March Madness" to appear on the main page and in my view does a great service to our readership, who are looking for articles related to current events of wide interest, while also satisfying on opposing editors who may believe that there is too much 'undue weight' given to certain events.

*:Actually, a lot of these problems could be solved if some American editors learnt enough to take a more global view of things. I believed all along that it was right to post this, but some of the "arguments" in favour were so pathetic, and insulting, assuming as they did that everyone all around the world already had the same knowledge of who Dick Clark was as the average American. These editors actually create antagonism among non-Americans, rather than helping the case for posting. I winced when I read some of the support posts here, even though I agreed with posting.

*'''Comment''' I'm not disputing here, but I am curious.  Why is it that reporting on a new television show is considered "promotion" of that show, but reporting on a new president is not considered "promotion" of that president?  When we report on a horse race, are we not "promoting" that horse race, in your sense?  And where does the difference lie?  Is reporting the existence of something necessarily promoting it?  By that definition, we would also be "promoting" an earthquake by reporting it, and ''everything'' that we include on ITN would be a "promotion". I'm just curious what you mean by that. [[User:Gregcaletta|Gregcaletta]] ([[User talk:Gregcaletta|talk]]) 20:05, 17 April 2012 (UTC)
::I think it's because a large amount of your proposed blurb is about how big the show is going to be in the future. That kind of speculative material is not suitable for an encyclopedia and is inherently unverifiable. It also reads like (poorly thought-out) promotional material. I also feel that (in general) broadcasters shouldn't be the story themselves; if the programme breaks any big stories in the future, it could be mentioned then. [[User:AlexTiefling|AlexTiefling]] ([[User talk:AlexTiefling|talk]]) 20:28, 17 April 2012 (UTC)
:::I agree. My description was highly inadequate.  I have updated it further, and here is a fuller explanation:
*'''Comment'''. There are '''''three''''' notable events that coincide here.  The airing of a new controversial international TV show is perhaps the least notable.  A more notable event is that this that the leader of Hezbollah, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by the U.S. the U.K. and other countries, has given his first interview with the West in over six years.  And the third notable event is Nasrallah's announcement "he would act as a mediator in the Syrian conflict" [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17747745 (BBC)].  Several articles will therefore have to be significantly updated in an event that has been covered on ever major news channel across the world: the [[Hassan Nasrallah]] and [[Hezbollah]] articles, the [[Julian Assange]] article, and the new article for ''The [[World Tomorrow]]'', which will not remain as a "stub-class" article for long.  [[User:Gregcaletta|Gregcaletta]] ([[User talk:Gregcaletta|talk]]) 20:35, 17 April 2012 (UTC)
::I find your predictions for the future of the article to be just as speculative as for the future of the show. And while I dare say the show may be reasonably notable (and thus my AfD for it may well fail), the simple debut of a TV show is not notable. Did we run and ITN for the BBC show [[Hardtalk]]? Not as far as I know. This isn't really news as we know it; it's people talking about the news. The frequency of the interviewee's interviews with 'the west' (is Russia the west?) isn't exactly compelling evidence of the show's newsworthiness. If Nasrallah's announcement about acting as a mediator is noteworthy, let's have a story about that separately; but I'm not convinced that it is - there's no evidence that anyone except Nasrallah regards his intervention as interesting or at all likely to succeed. And really, don't delude yourself: this has not happened on 'every major news channel across the world' - this is primarily the work of RT, which can hardly be regarded as a reliable or unbiased source. [[User:AlexTiefling|AlexTiefling]] ([[User talk:AlexTiefling|talk]]) 20:56, 17 April 2012 (UTC)
:::I stand by "every major news channel across the world".  You must be ignoring the links I posted to BBC, CNN, The Guardian, AFP etc.  There have also been articles in the New York Times and, need I repeat myself, every major news channel across the world. Look it up.  [[User:Gregcaletta|Gregcaletta]] ([[User talk:Gregcaletta|talk]]) 21:56, 17 April 2012 (UTC)
::::Nasrallah's announcement is the lead aspect of a lot of these stories. If you want to write a separate ITN nomination for that, go for it. I'd still oppose it myself, but I think it has a lot more merit than all this absurd puffery for Julian Assange. Once again: "TV show launched" is fundamentally not real news. A lot of the reporting that is not about Nasrallah is in the 'people' sections of these news outlets: they are reporting on the entertaining behaviour of a narcissistic blond suspected rapist, not proclaiming that this TV show is a major breakthrough in our lives. And repeating a claim does not make it true; does anything in the stories actually support your contention that the launch of the show is itself newsworthy? The burden lies on you to demonstrate this with facts, not wild assertions. [[User:AlexTiefling|AlexTiefling]] ([[User talk:AlexTiefling|talk]]) 22:09, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - The reason why we post elections for every country recognised by the United Nations is to avoid any form of bias and also, to argue the merits of a country per se is a complete waste of time. One may go past decades of history to determine whether that country is "newsworthy" or not. Also the number of representatives for that country on Wikipedia can also sway votes. For example, New Zealand is a fairly small nation however there are many New Zealanders here on Wikipedia who are able to advocate their support for the posting of New Zealand elections as oppose to a nations like East Timor where there probably won't any Wikipedian representing it.

*'''Support''' I think this is significant enough to post, once an article is ready for it. The attacks were spread throughout Afghanistan, and were focused on embassies of several countries, and the Afghanistan Parliament building. Despite not being very successful attacks, the intent of the attacks is significant, and it does show that the Afghan security forces can handle attacks without aid from NATO forces. However, the blurb is too long, and should be shortened to "[[Taliban]] insurgents launch coordinated attacks on central [[Kabul|Kabul, Afghanistan]]." The blurb may also need to be changed as more details get released. -- [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|cont]]) 18:56, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''- Honestly, what is diminishing about this compared to the recent BRICS conference we posted? All of the above arguments are against summits in general, and are invalid as we have an indubitable precedence to post notable summits regardless of their results. I would like to see an argument as to why this summit particularly is of lesser importance as opposed to ranting about the sneaky way this was added to ITN/R. I request that this discussion be reopened.

*:The difference was that the other summits were probably at ITN/R (for better or for worse, I have a sneaking suspicion on how they got on the list), so it was senseless to oppose them; this one was sneakily added so there's a reason to oppose this. When this is posted at the start/while the summit is ongoing, it's akin to posting a sports topic at the start of the preseason. Sure, anyone can argue that it's like rocket launches, but launching per se is a significant achievement, unlike holding a regularly-scheduled summit (indeed, when a summit like this is cancelled/postponed, then that becomes news). –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 02:55, 15 April 2012 (UTC)
*::I don't care about how this was added to ITNR. That is irrelevant to the discussion. Your logic seems to be based on the fact that if a summit is not on ITNR, it doesn't belong on ITN, and that since in your opinion summits should not be on ITN because of their occurrence. That is true, but this is an exception because we never confirmed that it shouldn't be on ITNR. We need to discuss this on its merits, not how it was added to ITNR. I want an argument which states why this summit does not belong on ITN when others do that is not based on ITNR, as there hasn't been a consensus that this definitely shouldn't be on ITNR. Until then, no substantive arguments have been brought why this should not be posted or not be put on ITNR; merely about the fact that its initial posting on ITNR was unreasonable.

*:::As what I've said earlier, the summit has to release something (an agreement, accord or whatever) before we can even discuss the merits of the summit per se. What I didn't say is that if this is not at the ITNR list, then it shouldn't be posted, nor if this is not ITNR-worthy.

*::::If a summit has to release something to be notable, why did we post so many other summits only on the basis of their occurence? For example, our blurb for the BRICS summit was "The fourth '''[[2012 BRICS summit|BRICS summit]]''' takes place in [[New Delhi]]." That is nearly identical to the nomination we have today, yet no one had an issue with it then. And seeing as this most certainly won't get posted, would you be willing to discuss it again when a report is released?

*::::::Are you trying to say that if it is on ITNR it just has to happen but if it is not then something has to come out of it? If that is the case, that would be unreasonable because it was never determined that the Summit of the Americas should not be on ITNR in the future, only that the way it was initially put on the list was unfair. A discussion could show that it should belong on ITNR, so for now we need to discuss on its merits. I would like to reinforce that at this point it should not matter whether the summit is on ITNR.

*:::::::If it's not on ITNR, we'd discuss it on its merits. It currently has no merits since nothing has come out of it. Now as for the other summits, they were listed on ITNR and ITNR allows for opening of summits, whether or not they've even discussed anything. That means we have no precedence to look up to, since (I figure) most summits nominated were at the ITNR list, so they'd be listed no matter what (unless of course on the hopefully (currently) mandatory update (such as the summit has begun, for the previous ones). –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 14:28, 15 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''' when updated. This is a complex argument so for clarity I've broken my observations down into numbered statements in case anyone wants to refer back to them.
# It is incompatible with NPOV to adopt a position based on the veracity or otherwise of North Korea.  Precisely ''what'' was launched is a matter of controversy and the decision reached must reflect that.  However, for the purposes of analysis we can consider each position in turn.
# If we accept the North Korean claims as accurate:
## This is covered by ITNR's Space exploration/Launch failures criteria.
## Notability is augmented on top of that because it is the first steps of another country towards space-faring status.  Although the provision for first indigenous launches refers only to successful launches it is clear that this is something that is considered to add notability.
# If we consider this to be a veiled weapons test:
## The Space exploration/Launch failures criteria still applies.  Although it clearly is not the intention of the way ITNR is drafted this ''was'' a rocket; further, an ICBM is technically a space vehicle.  Wikilawyering perhaps, but that is what ITNR ''says''.  Given the ambiguous nature of its status in any case I would say we have enough to legitimately assert it for the actual story.
## The element of subterfuge adds notability rather than detracts from it.
# This has been widely reported in the global media as a lead story.  This is not some regional or national item struggling to attain wider notability.
#  However, as yet I don't see a substantive update anywhere.  We've got a bit at [[Taepodong-2]] and a few other bits and pieces elsewhere, but no one article that I can see that has what we would consider to be a minimum update.

*Obviously we should wait for the indictment to actually be filed, if indeed one is going to occur. Second, the best way to analyze the newsworthiness in this case is via the nature of the controversy. Civil rights activists such as [[Al Sharpton]] and [[Jesse Jackson]] have made an incredible amount of noise over this case. Being newsworthy figures themselves, they will of course propel this story to the international circuit. This in turn has sparked a number of reactions from other activists with similar agendas. Now, in the midst of all of this, there is so little that we actually know about the case itself, due to the fact that information and evidence of varied nature has been trickling out extremely slowly. Thus we have a great deal of contention between people who believe that [[George Zimmerman]] is guilty, and between those who contend he acted in self-defense. So, I agree that this is an extremely controversial and high-profile case.

::*I oppose it because the indictment is trivial and has no significance until the actual verdict is delivered. I think there will be clear consensus that the verdict will be notable and we are not a news ticker that posts every update to stories, so it seems unreasonable to post this when it is merely an intermediate phase of a piece of news.

At best, this is tabloid news and Zimmerman's arrest does not even represent the final news item that is going to come out of this case. When this goes through the court system and results in a major change to US law (which I don't think will happen, but you never know) then it would be good enough for ITN, but not now. As it is now, the story is of tabloid interest.

:::*I have tried to address the many poor aspects of the article at its Talk page, and have been shouted down by bigots who obviously feel they have some sort of ownership of it. It's a recent and controversial topic, involving racism, youth culture, national politics, gated communities, America's extreme (by world standards) gun laws, and the unusual (by world standards) "stand your ground" law. The article is still very unstable, with 70 edits in the past 24 hours. Editors continuously push POVs that just wouldn't exist in a more mature article. There has been no legal resolution, and it's unknown when there will be resolutions to the other issues. Sourcing "facts" in that article just means finding someone else in the US media who shares your POV. It proves nothing. Some editors succeeded in hiding from the title the critical fact that Martin is dead. I gave up editing and discussing because of the aggressive and bullying culture that has evolved around the article. Nobody should ever feel the need to do that.

In some ways its the culmination of the story, with the actual trial being a post-script (for some campaigners, I guess the line is that justice demands the suspect be tried, but not necessarily that he be found guilty). I don't know enough about the case to really judge the article, but I do get the impression that there have been a lot of POV issues relating to it. Maybe these are resolved, but I'd be nervous about front-paging an article about an ongoing criminal process unless we are very confident that it is accurate and balanced.

*'''Oppose''' For the good reasons explained above. There is a dangerously rich thread running through the article and its nominations, tasting  of bias, prejudice, and drum-thumping point making. At the very core of the nomination is the story itself, and its small, regional, insignificant, notable only to a part of a country not even to an entire region never mind the world. There are issues with the article itself brought here which may never be resolved if the tone of the comments posted here are any guide. In short - no. [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 06:51, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''(Strong) Support''' I rarely provide supports or opposes on nominations, but I feel so strongly about this I will post. First off, let me say as a point of order that I disagree with the concept of ''Strong'' Opposes and Supports. Yes, yes, I know this isn't about votes, but we know those bolded words amount to a lot in the eyes of whoever ends up reviewing the nomination. So, let me reiterate my position that you can't make your stance (Support or Oppose) stronger: you can only make it weaker than the standard Support/Oppose. However, I've decided to make mine a "Strong Support", primarily so that whoever reviews this doesn't take my opinion as meaning less simply because I omitted the word ''Strong''.
:Okay, with that out of the way... I think most of the opposers fail to understand the magnitude of this case. This is ''not'' a "local crime story". At the very least, this is a national crime story, covered almost non-stop for the past month in the U.S. news, in part because of its implications on race and because of the renewed interest in "stand your ground" laws across the country. From what I have gathered, this has also been covered in many international news sources as well, perhaps because it's great fodder for the "look at those crazy American laws". So, this is a crime with effects across the U.S., and interest from around the world.
:Now as to whether this is appropriate now or at the verdict, I say, why not both? I'm not pre-supporting a post of the verdict, but indictments in some cases are on their own notable. Think about the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case, for example. Obviously, the political implications are not as grand in the Trayvon Martin case. But for the past month, the furor hasn't necessarily been over "Why hasn't this guy been convicted yet?", it's "Why hasn't he even been charged with anything?" So, this is truly the culmination of this story. He has been charged with the highest crime that could conceivably be applied to this case (first-degree murder is obviously not applicable). So, while the wheels of justice turn, you are likely to see the nationwide protests and interest rapidly wane. When the verdict comes, especially if it's acquittal, we will probably see another big news story, one that likely will be postable. But, that's for another day. We're not going to post every gory detail of this case, but one around now, coinciding with its culmination, and one a year or so from now, at its conclusion, is not too much. We are not (''clearly'') limited in the number of stories we can post to ITN, so this worry about "if we post this now, we can't post this later" is misguided.
:As for the quality of the article, again, I don't see the issue. Clearly, it's not featured quality, and it has its issues. But this high bar for articles in ITN is being applied exclusively in this case. We post worse on ITN -- and I don't see a problem with that. At best, I just see a couple people here bitter that their opinions about the article were in the minority. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 07:44, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
::Nope, just sad that appalling logic, ignorance and bullying have so much impact on content in Wikipedia. You just displayed such traits yourself in telling us that the majority rules here.

:::Right, like I said, bitter. You have made it sound like you went to the ends of the Earth to fix quality issues with the article. This is not true. Your primary contribution to discussion at the article was expletive-laden comments about how the title needs to include both "shooting" and "death". You then proceeded to use your failure to get other people to agree as a reason why this shouldn't be on ITN. I can easily see why you think both words should be in the title, but the majority did not agree, and there was no consensus for a different name. Sorry, that's the way the cookie crumbles. That's the way things work.

You already stated your position; I read it, I did not misunderstand it, and I did not respond to it. I don't particularly care for hearing it again. I responded to the oppose votes earlier because none of them provided a reason, and when they did, I thanked them for them and did not respond further. Those are matters of opinion, and perfectly reasonable stances. But ErrantX's makes a statement that is objectively false. He stated, for one, that this story has "zero exposure" outside the U.S. directly below a comment from someone who said it's a front pager on the BBC and The Independent. I'm sorry, but it's difficult to tow the not-a-vote line, when it's considered improper to respond to such obviously incorrect statements.

This has had minimal mainstream coverage in the UK, France, Italy  etc. mostly under the world news sections. According to a close friend in the US this isn't headline news in her state. So that is what I am basing my view on. My "finger in the air" judgement on these things would be "If I ask a random person on the street what is the likelihood they've heard of this".

I assumed if it was the top story on the BBC site in India that it would also be the case in the UK, since neither of those locations is actually associated with this story (and India is certainly much farther away).

** Woah! looks like everybody's on at least seven cans of red bull. Here's my elaboration on why I opposed it. '''(1) Local Crime:''' I would think the crime itself is not ITN worthy as it is a local crime by which I meant that the direct victims are limited number of local citizens (eg: homicide, burglary, arson) as opposed to a national crime where the crime is against the state itself (eg: terrorism, treason) or against large sections of people across the state (eg: large scale financial crimes, crimes against entire communities, etc). I am sure the above are not recognized definitions of local crimes and national crimes, but the point I was trying to make was that the crime in itself does not have a large impact. '''(2) No Major Consequences:''' So then, has the crime triggered any event worthy of ITN notability ? The important consequencecs I have been able to identify (from article and comments posted above) are '''(2a) Allegations of Racism and Police Misconduct''': Both are yet to been established in a court of law (my understanding of US law indicates that US follows the "innocent until proven guilty" policy) and even if established, these will not be too out of the ordinary in contemporary society, '''(2b) Debate regarding Florida's stand-your-ground law''': Legal positions in most developed and developing countries are in a constant state of evolution and flux. The legal concept in question is merely one of the factors in determining whether the defence of ''personal self defence'' is available in a homicide or assault case. There is no change in any key legal principle  of US law like a change in constitutional framework, abolition of death penalty, introduction of a new legislation or legalization of a previously prohibhited major activity. Even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that this is one of the key legal principles of US law, what has happened so far is merely a debate - this legal provision is yet to be set aside or changed either by the legislature through a statutory amendment or by the judiciary through any judicial pronouncement. '''(3) Media Attention:''' I'll admit that this has garnered significant media attention, but while it can be a contributory factor in determining notability, it cannot be the only criterion (for example, that Japanese fishing boat lost in the Tsunami being found near the North American coast was reported pretty much everywhere). I think its been sufficiently debated and laid to rest in this forum that media attention alone cannot determine notability.

:::I'm no seismologist, but one really shouldn't go by magnitude alone; the effect of earthquakes doesn't just depend on the magnitude, but also other factors like depth.

::::Yes, the effect of earthquakes can depend on other things, like depth, but that doesn't factor in here. The real reason this didn't cause more damage is that it was so far from land and because it was a strike-slip fault (which generally doesn't generate tsunamis). The vast majority of casulaties and damage in both the 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011 Japan earthquake (both of whose epicenters were offshore) were from the tsunami rather than the actual shaking. So, this is definitely a strong earthquake, but it would really need to generate a tsunami to do real damage. Tsunamis tend to occur as a result of vertical displacement in the plates, which doesn't, by definition, occur along strike slip faults (look at Part A of [[:File:Fault types.svg|this image]]); tsunamis, at the very least, must occur on a fault (normal or reverse) that has vertical movement or, better yet, on subduction zones, which result in massive vertical displacements of fluid. The 2004, 2011 (and most other tsunamis) were in subduction zones. Long story short: strong, and fairly uncommon earthquake, with fortunate location keeping this from being a disaster. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 17:34, 11 April 2012 (UTC)

Of course, the world population has grown substantially, but the locations of those earthquakes is still considered rather remote. The frequency of this type of earthquake is difficult to gauge: [[:File:USGS magnitude 8 earthquakes since 1900.svg|this image]] shows that the last 8.5-magnitude earthquake (ignore the file name; it's referring to 8.5-magnitude quakes) prior to 2004 was nearly forty years earlier (the 1965 one), but since then, this makes the sixth. This is the highest magnitude earthquake in 47 years to cause no casualties, but this isn't a product of amazing engineering, just chance location. Today's quake, recall, was nearly 500 km from a somewhat populated location. [[:File:USGS map of the 2012 Indian Ocean Earthquake.jpg|Shaking]] felt on even the closest land was relatively minor.

This is not a "puppet state of Russia" and to portray it as such is a gross misrepresentation.  Western media coverage has been highly selective and biased in this area: it was widely reported when the Russians went in as if it was some unprovoked act of naked aggression.  The trigger for that - Kiev sending in troops against its own people who had the audacity to demand autonomy - was conveniently ignored.

*'''Barking up the wrong tree''': There is no requirement to debate the international recognition of South Ossetia. I had mentioned this in the Abkhazia nomination as well, but I'm quoting the criteria for posting elections from the ITN/R page again: ''"Disputed states and dependent territories should be discussed at WP:ITN/C and judged on their own merits"''. So the fact that South Ossetia is disputed or dependent does not disqualify it. Even if we were to concede (for argument sake) that the primary argument of most of the opposers that it is not a "recognized state" or that it is a "puppet state" were true, that still does not disqualify this ITN nomination. Its extreme POV and systemic bias if you start disqualifying de-facto independent territories just because they are not recognized by the West or just because [http://www.war-stories.com/aspprotect/images/poster-wwii-ally-russian-this-man-is-your-friend.jpg another nation] exerts more influence on them than the Western countries.

*****Yes, in British English, "college" tends to refer to a level of education equivalent to the latter years of high school and/or freshman year of university in the U.S. But, I really can't believe most British readers (Mjroots, obviously not included) would not have either (a) known that in the U.S., "college" refers to university-level education or at least (b) known that that nomination was about university-level sports. From my understanding, the notion that "college" means something else ''over there'' [i.e. in the U.S.] is not an uncommon piece of knowledge in the UK. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 22:42, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

Or is this more about Oxbridge thing than it being an athletic competition? If it is then that truly is a very limited scope; if it is not, then we'd have to judge this as an athletic competition with all of the "mid-level sporting event" argument Kevin told us.

Unlike basketball, this is an event with wide appeal. Unlike "the first 1080 in skateboarding" or whatever it was, this is a credible sport and not just a hobby. Ultimately the event falls on the right side of "important".

*'''Reluctant oppose''' In ordinary circumstances I'd have no problems with posting.  Comparisons to random American college sporting events are at best misguided: there is a difference between asserting that a union of two or more factors lends notability to a broad class of possible nominations (i.e. "This is a popular sport, college sport is popular, ergo this is notable") and putting forward a ''single'' nomination as a stand-out event.  No one here is suggesting we start posting British university or college football or boxing or whatever, the assertion is that this ''one event'' is notable.
:On the other hand I am actually opposing this, and that is due to the swimmer incident.  This is one man with an axe to grind to has already received far more publicity than he actually deserves because of the childish and disruptive manner he went about making his point.  The coverage we give of his "argument" (which appears so far to be poorly developed and lacking any intrinsic substance) should be based on its intrinsic notability.  IMHO fair coverage here amounts to zip, and since we can't cover the substantive story without including the protest we don't cover it at all to avoid undue prominence.

*'''Oppose''' Regional interest.  I am specifically skeptical of the claims that it is viewed in 180 countries; on a very technical level, that's probably true, but that's also true of countless other even less significant sporting events.  Referencing The Boat Race's homepage, it would appear that most countries received the broadcast via BBC, which is certainly a major news outlet, but is also very specifically a British news source.  The claim that it's viewed in 180 countries would suggest that it receives major coverage by all those countries, on the scale of something like the World Cup (Association Football), which it does not. - [[User:OldManNeptune|OldManNeptune]] [[User_talk:OldManNeptune|⚓]] 03:26, 8 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''.  Far less significant that the basketball nomination which was not posted.  That the use of the phrase 'global interest' in this thread is a classic example of how that factor is misused at ITN.  'Global interest' (if indeed that's the case here) doesn't' mean 'global significance'.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 09:31, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' It is significant due to the nature of the race, see [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-08/protester-halts-historic-oxford-cambridge-boat-race/3938154/?site=melbourne High drama for historic Oxford-Cambridge boat race] and for the "''security questions ahead of the Olympics and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee''. Those that are opposing it due to the link with basketball, shame on you, how is a basketball event which nothing unexpected happened relate to this, lets hope the reviewing admin discountes them, they have no place here.

[[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 15:55, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::Globally observed sporting events happen every day.  I just watched a league football match, which unlike boat race was available via streaming internet (legally) where I am, that had a controversial penalty that's being discussed the world over. Is that ITN worthy?  As has been pointed out above several times, the size of the 'global audience' for this is highly questionable.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 18:04, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::No, it's fine, I accept the "questionability" of a global audience here, but your "league football match" is not a once-a-year event that has taken place since 1829 where the athletes train all year for one single 17-minute event, is it?  In any case, we'll see this again next year, and we'll see the boring NCAA vs the-rest-of-the-world arguments forever, so perhaps we're all better off just moving on and doing something less boring instead.  I certainly am. [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 19:16, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' The stopping of the race was a trivial event. Also, I note that the NCAA Basketball Tournament, which engages nearly 70 U.S. universities, is of great interest to both news media and oddsmakers, and included a game attended by the U.S. president and the UK prime minister, was deemed to be too minor a sports event to warrant attention at ITN. If that's too minor a topic for ITN, then the Boat Race surely is too minor to qualify. --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 15:31, 8 April 2012 (UTC)
*:It seems that NCAA March Madness isn't even the proper comparison to this event. In March Madness, more than 60 teams are selected from hundreds of teams around the U.S.; this one is between two schools. It's more akin to the American college football rivalry games, such as the [[The Game (Harvard-Yale)|The Game]], or the most equivalent comparison should be the [[Harvard–Yale Regatta]]. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 16:13, 8 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' This has nothing to do with college basketball. It's a trivial amateur event that only gains attention because of it's history and that it is held in London, where 300 thousand people out of a metro population of 14 million come to watch.

**U.S events are always going to have a tougher road to the nomination, regardless of whether this gets through or not.  Take for example the [[Rio de Janerio school shooting]] to the most recent H.S one in the U.S (or heck even the Christian university one in Oakland which wasn't even nominated), [[Gary Speed]] vs. [[Al Davis]], or the clusterfreak over the [[Penn State sex abuse scandal]] and later JoePa's death. [[User:Hbdragon88|hbdragon88]] ([[User talk:Hbdragon88|talk]]) 01:16, 9 April 2012 (UTC)
***Shooting incidents in the US are never going to surprise nor seem newsworthy to people from other places because of what they see as America's insane gun laws. Sex scandals happen all over the world, and are rarely posted here. And old football coaches die everywhere too. Heck, I couldn't get the ridiculously young death of one of the most amazing people to ever play [[Aussie Rules]], [[Jim Stynes]], posted here recently. I still think though that the NCAA thing could have been posted had it been promoted a little more objectively and wisely. (WTF does "filling a bracket" mean to a non-American? Anyone who used that as part of an argument was off their brain.) [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 01:29, 9 April 2012 (UTC)
**I was under the impression that ITN wasn't for specialized local events unless there was some extra circumstance making them especially newsworthy.  In any case, sports are especially sticky since virtually all sports have regionalized interest (on top of already being of speciality interest, namely to sports fans) and hence a large (perhaps vast majority) of readers will not be even mildly interested.  Regardless of whether you view American laws as insane or not, a school shooting is almost indisputably of greater impact than a local sports contest.  But, most of those get passed over as well, and rightfully so. - [[User:OldManNeptune|OldManNeptune]] [[User_talk:OldManNeptune|⚓]] 11:03, 9 April 2012 (UTC)

*******Well, I hope you've noticed that I haven't actually opposed the nomination. I've suggested explaining what NCAA is (colloquially, not just what it stands for), and telling us what's special about THIS year's event. (If that didn't matter, it would be ITNR.) Comparisons with other countries, crowds and all, probably don't help, because we all know that the USA has a huge population anyway. (If population size was all that mattered, everything here would be Chinese, Indian and American.) How it ranks as an event within America is relevant. Is it the top tournament outside NBL? (See, I DO know something about your country.) Hope this helps. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 02:01, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
********Ok, let's see if I can explain this. The NCAA is basically the national body that oversees all university athletics. For professional sports the various sports have their own organizations (NBA, NHL, MLB, [[Professional Bowlers Association|PBA]], whatever), whereas for university level it's the NCAA for all sports. Most people couldn't care less about college sports other than basketball or football. For football and basketball the NCAA level competition is just as significant as the professional organizations. It is also of importance because athletes in all of the major professional US sports have to play in the NCAA first whether or not they are good enough to play at the professional level (with the exception of baseball, where prospects can be drafted out of high school). This year's event, in all honesty, isn't any more significant than any other year's tournament to the average citizen, but those from the same state as the teams (like me from Kansas) and those who's alma mater is one of the teams it is arguably more significant (not to say it isn't significant to others, just that it may not be of more significance than any other year's). In America this tournament may actually be more significant than the NBA's playoffs even though the NBA is the professional level. If it says anything the entire tournament (all 65+ games) are broadcast live on national television. Not sure how much more I can explain it...sorry it's a somewhat rambling paragraph. Hope this helps, [[User:Ks0stm|<font color="009900">'''Ks0stm'''</font>]] <sup>([[User talk:Ks0stm|T]]•[[Special:Contributions/Ks0stm|C]]•[[User:Ks0stm/Guestbook|G]]•[[User:Ks0stm/Email|E]])</sup> 02:15, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''' The NCAA Tournament is internationally broadcasted (not only on television, but streaming online worldwide), and it does have a following with basketball fans in other countries. Even those who don't watch sports end up filling out [[Bracketology|brackets]]. Last year's tournament had 20.1 million viewers in the US, more than the 17 million viewers that last years NBA Finals (an ITN/R event) averaged over 6 games (See [[2011 NBA Finals]], [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]). Basketball fans worldwide know about, and most likely watch or follow, two major events that are held every year, the [[NBA Finals]], and the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]]. The fact that it is collegiate athletics and not professional athletics shouldn't matter at all, since the caliber of talent shown in these games is far from amateur level (I.E [[Pick-up game]]).

*'''Support''' - The tournament is a major news story in the US for weeks.  The final last year was watched by over 20 million viewers, which puts it ahead of many other sporting events (I'm not sure, but I think that would be more viewers than hockey, tennis, or golf gets in the US for any single game/match/day of play).  I don't see why anyone is even discussing the amateur nature of the event.  How does that have anything to do with whether or not we should list it on ITN?  Isn't the amount of coverage something gets and the number of people it is interesting to what decides whether it should be listed?  In my opinion, being a major news story and one of the most watched sporting events in the US is enough to qualify it (though I can understand if other people vote against it because it isn't of much interest outside the US).

:::::::Such as the ones I listed below (which is why I didn't list them here).  And I am trying to get this onto ITN/R (that's why I'm posting here, or is a separate discussion needed somewhere else for that)?  About the tournament's signficance, it is very significant among sports fans in the United States.  Many millions of people fill out brackets picking the winners of every game of the tournament, which normally isn't done with other sports.  My impression is that far more people fill out brackets than actually watch the finals, since many people's teams will have lost by then.  Also, the amount of coverage the tournament gets is quite large, and the fact that current presidents have shown interest in it might also add to the importance (e.g. Barack Obama fills out brackets, Bill Clinton attended the Final Four while president).  In terms of actual viewship, the Final Four of the tournament it is about on par with the NBA finals.  I think basketball is behind both professional and college football and professional baseball in overall popularity in the US, but is ahead of other sports (e.g. hockey, soccer, tennis, golf).

*'''Comment''' - I've already voted support above, but I want to comment that I think this item should be added to [[WP:ITNR]], or else many other sporting events should be removed.  There are many items in [[WP:ITNR]] that seem like they would only be of interest to people from specific countries.  As an American, I have no idea what hurling is, let alone care what team wins the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]].  However, I understand that it is probably an important event for Irish people, so I don't mind having it be covered ITN.  Likewise, I don't really care who wins the Japan Series, the Grey Cup, the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, etc., but understand that they are probably big news stories in the countries where they are played.  For basketball, I had never even heard of EuroBasket or Euroleague Basketball, but if a lot of European people are interested in them, then I'm fine with them being covered by ITN.  I don't understand why so many people object to sporting events that are popular in the US, yet give a free pass to events that are popular in other countries.  I really doubt that more people in the English speaking world care about the Japan Series than about the NCAA basketball tournament.  The number of people in the US who watch the NCAA tournament is about 3 times the entire population of Ireland (including Northern Ireland), so I also really doubt that this event is of less intrest to the English speaking world as a whole then Irish sporting events are.  I'm not saying that those events should be removed from ITNR, but it just seems hypocritical to me that people seem to oppose American sports when lots of other sporting events that I would think are of less general interest are included in ITNR.

Anyway, I'm not saying that higher viewership means something is of interest to more countries, but that it is of interest to a larger proportion of the people who are reading Wikipedia.  That generally would be because a larger proportion is from one country than another (e.g. more Wikipedia readers are from the US than Ireland).

* As a sport story, '''oppose''' as age restricted competition cannot, by definition, be the highest level of a sport.  The issue here is whether it qualifies under some scarcely defined, but not unprecedented, popular culture category.  We are, I would suggest, looking at something that is better compared with ''Strictly Come Dancing'', ''The Apprentice'' or ''Eurovision'', or maybe the Oxford-Cambridge boat race.  Although the context happens to be sport, this is more likely to fairly judged as a natural shared interest.  As such, I would oppose it, as I oppose all those "popular interest" stories, but less strongly so than as a sports story, as we do sometimes feature this category.

BTW - you're welcome, rest of world, for this site. Geeze.

* Honestly the Women's tournament had a much more significant impact than this, considering Baylor became the first NCAA basketball team men or women to have 40 wins in a season, has probably the most hyped women's college basketball player ever in [[Brittney Griner]], and it broke so many records in the process.

*'''Sorry to pester''', but the blurb now says "a majority of contested seats". This is an improvement, but it seems like a weak way to put it. If my calculator is working properly, they won 95.5% of seats that were contested or 97.7% of seats that they contested.
