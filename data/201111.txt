::The fact that ICC has so far only investigated African countries is hardly surprising, given that Africa is a huge continent with the most countries of any continent - and the vast majority of dictatorships.

*'''Request for clarification''' Exactly what is happening? One thing I do know is that American law in this area is very different from that in my country (and it doesn't matter what that is). The source don't say "''bankruptcy''". They say "''Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection''." Obviously the rest of the world is unlikely to have the same chapter 11 of whatever book it comes from. While Americans may all(?) know what it means, can the blurb/article give us a more global explanation please? How does it impact on passengers? And not just here on this page. It needs to be in the blurb and/or article(s). [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 19:37, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. "Chapter 11 refers to [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code]] (and not a book - I'm not sure if that was intended as a joke). It's the most common type of bankruptcy protection/reorganization process for corporations. Generally this means the corporation is delisted from the stock exchange, with operations ongoing (and substantially owned by debtors). I am not familiar with what the reorganization usually entails, but I believe Chapter 11 protection is fairly common for airlines and unlikely to cause big changes. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 21:16, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
::So, in terms of impact on the broader community (which seems to me to be the important thing here), there won't be much? If that's the case, it doesn't seem like major news. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 21:34, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''; reorganization while continuing to operate is not a huge deal. If it were the largest bankruptcy ever then I would support, but it does not appear to be. --[[User:Golbez|Golbez]] ([[User talk:Golbez|talk]]) 21:56, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''.  The gist of Chapter 11 bankruptcy is that A) American Airlines believes that they do not have enough cash equivalents available to meet all of their current and near future debt obligations (and hence is bankrupt, or soon would be), and B) they want to start a process where they attempt to restructure / reduce their debt obligations by negotiating with creditors (under court supervision) to forgive some of their debt with the assumption that creditors will ultimately receive a larger share of what they are owed if the business continues operating than if the business were simply shut down and liquidated.  Generally, one expects that the current stockholders will be wiped out (stock value goes to zero or practically zero), and the debtors agree to write off some of the debt while receiving significant ownership rights in the restructered company.  Creditors have to agree to such a scheme and will often take substantial losses in the process.  If they can't reach an agreement, the alternative is to sell the company and liquidate its assets in order to pay creditors.  When debts are large relative to the value one might expect during a rushed sale, such an action may provide relatively little compensation to debt holders, and hence they have an incentive to attempt reorganization.  Chapter 11 bankruptcy is the most common form of bankruptcy for large corporations in the US and has been very common for airlines.  By total assets, this is the second largest airline bankruptcy ever (behind United Airlines in 2002).  In the United example, we saw the company reduce payroll by 20% (via layoffs, furloughs, etc.), decrease their inventory of planes by 15%, reduce and reorganize their routes.  Some ticket holders ultimately found their flight / route no longer existed though they were likely to be compensated.  American's bankruptcy is a big financial story and matters a great deal for their investors and employees, but probably will have relatively little impact on ordinary people who aren't directly affiliated with the airline.  If it went to liquidation it would be a much bigger deal, but that is unlikely, and in any event would probably take years before it occurred.

::I'm still not clear. Is AA bankrupt (in the normal sense that it cannot pay its current liabilities), or is it indicating that there is a present threat of that becoming the case? --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 01:16, 30 November 2011 (UTC)
:::A bankruptcy filing indicates that they feel it is foreseeable and unavoidable that they will be unable to pay current liabilities at some point in the future.  It is not uncommon to see companies file literally the night before a debt comes due that they would be forced to default on due to lack of funds.  These filings allow the company to defer some payments (subject to court supervision) so that the company can maintain the operating capital necessary to run the business.  In other cases the filing may anticipate the true default by weeks, months, or even years out of a desire to maintain enough working capital to make restructuring viable, but in those cases there is still a declaration that default will be unavoidable without the protection of bankruptcy court.  It appears that AA is the latter kind.  They have $4B cash on hand, but have lost money each of the last four years and are expected to post a loss of ~$1.2B for 2011.  So they are actually years away from cash flow crisis per se, but they believe that it is inevitable without restructuring.  The fact that they do have a large cash reserve makes it likely they will be able to restructure successfully without large disruptions to passengers.

He was the owner/general manager of the NFL Oakland Raiders, which experienced both wild winning streaks (three Super Bowls and 15 playoff appearances) and losing streaks (eight losing seasons from 2002-2010), and caused all sorts of controversy off the field by suing the NFL, moving the team around, and hiring minorities in positions of power.  I'm not saying that "no Davis = no Speed" '''but''' I just want to know what distinguishes the two; why this entry has so much more support than Davis; if this is proper "American football equivalent" in terms of accomplishments/popularity/"notability"; if we made a mistake in not featuring Davis (if this gets posted) or it's proper that the deaths of football managers not be listed.

*'''Post-posting support''' - read the above discussion earlier today, and was intending to come here and support, but found it had been posted. The wording is not good, though. "found hanged"? All you need to say is that he has died and say something about his career (he was, as others have noted, more notable for his career as a footballer, rather than being manager of Wales). Putting the emphasis on how he died shows a lack of respect. This has been the major story in the UK sports news for the past few days, and the BBC have had many separate articles on many aspects of this story (at least 10-20 separate articles, which is an extraordinary amount for a single person's death). An example is [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15928380 here], which includes a picture of many of the tributes fans have made, plus: ''"politicians in the Welsh assembly observed a minute's silence in his honour"'' and an Early Day Motion has been tabled in the House of Commons: ''"MPs from all parties in the House of Commons tabled a motion offering the House's sympathies to Speed's wife and two sons"'' and ''"Supporters have left scarves, football shirts and flowers across several football stadiums - including Everton's Goodison Park, at Leeds United's Elland Road, Newcastle United's St James' Park, the Millennium Stadium and Cardiff City Stadium"'', plus the opening of a book of condolences and tributes planned at the start of football games this weekend. There is plenty there for a more respectful hook than "found hanged". [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 01:27, 30 November 2011 (UTC)
*:The wording of that has been changed a few times already, due to issues raised at [[WP:ERRORS]]. Nevertheless, I have changed it to "found dead". I think "dies" suggests that it was of natural causes or, at the very least, an accident. If he were murdered, for example, we wouldn't have said "dies"; we would have said "killed". But, I agree that the method of death is not central; we just also shouldn't suggest it was of natural causes (n.b. I think "found dead" was similar to what we used for the death of Amy Winehouse). -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 01:41, 30 November 2011 (UTC)

Tariq has made the right choice here too - the arguments are very well advanced from either side, though taken from a few steps back the view is that there is reason to post. It would be meaningless had there been a clear rejection of the story, and Tariq had concluded a biased anti-whatever view was clouding the discussion and posted it anyway. (Ditto Occupy - had Tariq posted the stories despite the mass objection to them). It is also worth noting that we have been growing increasingly slow in posting news events on the front page - in some cases three or 4 days between updates - which would have helped the case of a story for which there was a view of significance.

*'''Comment'''. There's resigning and then there's ''offering'' to resign. If the story develops so that we have a new cabinet, then I'd give this a strong support. But I think it's too much ahead of the curve just for the moment. --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 21:42, 21 November 2011 (UTC) 
** The news is that there are renewed violent protests in Egypt, with many casualties, and government offering resignation. Regardless of whether the military accepts the resignation, these events are significant enough to undermine the fragile provisional political setup. [[User:Crnorizec|Crnorizec]] ([[User talk:Crnorizec|talk]]) 21:46, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Strong support''' ''now'', since it calls back to the deadly protests with an instability caused by the resignation of the government. We don't need to wait until the new cabinet is announced, as the violent protests anew seem to be sufficient for posting anyway.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 21:51, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
::I don't think we need to wait until a new cabinet is sworn in, just until this one's resignation has actually been accepted. If that doesn't happen, then that doesn't mean we can't post anything else that's going on in Egypt. But I don't think the cabinet resignation is the story until it happens. In which case, it most definitely will be the story. --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 21:53, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
:::The offer for resignation is not the only notable ongoing event here. Protests anew with immense media attention and death toll are surely more significant.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 22:02, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
::::OK, but the blurb that's been proposed says: "The government of Egypt resigns...". --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 22:03, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
:::::That's the least problem. I did note the wording lately and you have my excuse for it. How about a blurb saying: "In the most recent '''[[2011 Egyptian revolution#November 2011 Protests|protests]]''' in [[Egypt]] at least 23 people are killed." And if the resignation is accepted: "Most recent '''[[2011 Egyptian revolution#November 2011 Protests|protests]]''' in [[Egypt]] in which at least 23 people are killed follow with a resignation of the government."--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 22:20, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
::::::That's better, but I'm not convinced that another round of protests in a region plagued with violence over the last year is really newsworthy. The deaths are tragic, but what's another 23 after the 100's already? --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 00:08, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''  "Offering to resign" is not a notable event [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 21:54, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Support''' to be posted immediately. Their offer of resignation will be accepted or declined within a day, and we can update the blurb then. Entire governments don't offer to resign often, so this is significant. [[User:Mamyles|Mamyles]] ([[User talk:Mamyles|talk]]) 22:56, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Strong support''' right now. The renewed protests are significant, and per Mamyles, when talking about a whole government, the mere offer of resignation is notable/significant. [[User:Jcgoble3|jcgoble3]] ([[User talk:Jcgoble3|talk]]) 23:19, 21 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Strong Oppose''' This is a local problem of limited global interest. We can't post to ITN every time XYZ government says it might do something. There is already the "intends to run" in Myanmar, and the intent for a Eurasian union. What's next? Syria promises reforms? Greece proposes new bill? Post to ITN when something ''actually happens'', not when some government says it wants to do something. --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 00:06, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
::Every first and second-world country is following the events in Egypt. It it far from limited global interest. And we can post every time a significant proposition is made, judging from the 16-36 hours between each ITN update. [[User:Mamyles|Mamyles]] ([[User talk:Mamyles|talk]]) 01:39, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
:::If every politician making a promise to placate an angry populate got on ITN, the page would be 200k of empty claims that never came to fruition. --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 02:59, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
::::Users can safely ignore remarks posted by 76.18.43.253 like the above one. Notice how he appeared out of nowhere and started making a stream of nonsensical opposes against obviously notable items. Then when I exposed his bullshit for what it is, he proceeded to follow me across five AfD nominations and vote the opposite way in every one of them. This, my friends, is the clear mark of a troll. The best strategy will be to ignore his inane comments from now on; once he gets bored, he will start trolling elsewhere on Wikipedia with a new IP. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 04:56, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Strong support''' for obvious reasons. As far as I'm concerned this is ITN/R material - an entire government is being reorganized as a result of violent protests.

*'''Oppose''' Support merit, but until the government is actually dissolved this isn't ready to be posted. "Offers" is also a rather informal word. Maybe something like, '''The interim government of Egypt tenders its resignation following violent riots that killed at least 30 protesters and wounded more than 1,200'''. Interim should be emphasized because no official government has been elected, yet.

*'''Support''' The news here is the protests in which 30 people died and that's what should get the focus. The government is fragile and unstable they can say we resign all day it doesn't mean they're gonna do it and they can't do it anyway since the military has to accept their resignation. If you want this to be posted you should amend the blurb and drop the resignation speculations.  --[[User:Tachfin|Tachfin]] ([[User talk:Tachfin|talk]]) 15:47, 22 November 2011 (UTC)
:I disagree. Thirty deaths is not all that notable in the large scheme of things. The government is the news, imo. --[[User:Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF0000">Plasma</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF4500">Twa</font>]][[User talk:Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF0000">2</font>]] 15:57, 22 November 2011 (UTC)

**Agreed. It's not a very famous battle, so if we post an article about the ship, most readers are going to refer back to [[Battle of Öland]] anyway.

****Because, despite the attention that the two-sentence stub has received from numerous users here, nobody seems able to come up with anything extra to say about it.

****:I think there's plenty of scope for expansion.  It's a very notable ship in historical terms.  The Norwegian article is already expanded.  It may not be suitable for ITN posting right now as a bolded article but I think it's worthy of an article.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 13:07, 20 November 2011 (UTC)
****::The Norwegian article has one inline citation, even if we dump a translation it still wouldn't be enough. Furthermore, it has only a section about the specs and another about the [[Battle of Öland]]. I'm not saying the ship article should be deleted but the battle article has much more substance potential that would interest the average reader and is already nicely expanded.

Scientists claim to have created World's lightest material. I was skeptic at first but its been published by [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6058/962 ScienceMag] and reading few articles ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15788735 BBC]) it looks like a very legit claim.

*'''Strong Oppose'''. Actually, what happened was that some scientists sought to find a reason for why the original experiment had its results, which runs completely against empirical evidence and thus is unlikely to be valid (even the original team who carried out the experiment said this much). One of common hypotheses was that the length of the bunches of neutrinos that were produced could introduce errors with the time difference measured. So the original team addressed this criticism by producing shorter bundles and somehow came up with the same results. This does not tell us at all that their original experiment was valid. In fact, this is not even a replication, since it was ran by the same team with almost exactly the same conditions. If some other fault with the design is to blame, then that fault still exists and so we would expect the same incorrect results to come out. 
*In short, we still do not know whether special relativity is indeed mistaken or whether some experimental error is to be blamed. In either case, this experiment is only a tiny step towards finding out. The independent experiment that is scheduled to be run a few months later in Japan would be a much more important stage in this process. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 17:25, 18 November 2011 (UTC)

::*Did you even read what I wrote? At no point did I make any claim whatsoever about the validity of the experiment. As I am not a working physicist, I am not in a position to do that. That is why I rely on the testimony of working scientists, whose [[Criticism_of_relativity_theory#Status_of_criticism|consensus opinion]] I stated. My friendly advice would be to read what you're responding to next time rather than citing some exotic philosophical article that you have little comprehension of. Thomas Kuhn, really? I'd have a little more respect for you if you bothered to read the sources and figure out what's actually going on instead of starting another one of your little rants about how everybody on ITN is in some kind of conspiracy to oppress your favourite topics. 
::*Did I at any point claim that certain scientists are wrong? I claimed that the ''experiment'' might be wrong, and the scientists who carried out the experiment themselves concurred that that was the most likely scenario. The entire point of revealing the experimental results was to hopefully let someone else figure out what the error was, rather than to attempt to discredit mainstream physics. ''No'' working physicist disputes the results of general relativity, just as no biologist disputes evolution and no serious mathematician works outside of the axiom of choice. But instead of educating yourself of the basic facts in this case, you choose to go and cite some metaphysical nonsense about how all science is really subjective and hence we cannot trust empirical evidence, so every little "anti-establishment" experiment that you favor for some reason deserves to be posted on ITN, and everyone who disagrees is just a delusional Einstein fanboy.

*'''Oppose''' Estimates of the size of the oil spill range from "a trickle" to around 650 barrels of oil, depending on who you believe. Either way, even 650 barrels is a lot less oil than the average cargo ship carries so this is hardly Earth-shattering stuff. However, the notability of this story may come in the near future as there are some indications (from the Brazilian government) that Chevron has been breaking a few drilling rules.

:::'''Comment''' Because we need to look at these nominations in the context of the wider issue. Occupy is a "special case" insofar as those pushing for front page credence seem to be very hasty in nominating every little blip and bluster that occurs. It is significant that almost all Occupy "movement" stories have failed to make it to the front page, and equally significant that people feel it necessary to nominate every latest little local difficulty (be it at Portland or New York or London).

I was struck by how quickly personal digs were thrown around in discussions elsewhere, it's constructive to have discussions without having to resort to that. I cannot change my mind on this, unfortunately, although the case you make is very sound. It is not convincing enough for me, ultimately, and even observed neutrally the event looks more of an Occupy-based story than a police-based one. Because of that, the lens through which the story is viewed becomes more important than the story itself. That is why I voiced concerns earlier about bias and politics. Have you put this story into today's (or the relevant day's) current affairs template?

*'''Strong Support'''. Depending on your personal political views, IAEA's report might or might not be a fair accusation. But there is no doubt that the very accusation itself is significant politically. It's also incorrect to say that IAEA has been accusing Iran of the same thing for many years. This as far as I know is completely incorrect; just a few years ago they released a highly controversial report (contradicting U.S. official position) saying that Iran did not have a nuclear weapons program. This is by far the strongest accusation (and evidence, if you believe it is legitimate) that Iran has a nuclear weapons program from an UN agency. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 05:56, 18 November 2011 (UTC)

:::True, but this is not a little-known organization, it's an international agency affiliated with the UN.

*'''Oppose''' This is a local issue with no global significance. "The IAEA accuses Iran of research" is a long way from an active weapons program or functional device.

On that basis we may as well shut down ITN now since ''nothing'' is going to hit a significance criteria set that high.

::Wikifan, don't make me repeat myself. The issue is not support. As had been said several times, it's the fact that in none of apparently three relevant articles, there is no sufficient update. This is quite typical of the ITN process. ''News items'' get adequate support, but ''articles'' don't get updated -- even after being told that the roadblock is an update. Nominators simply argue that updates are sufficient, further delaying the nomination's addition to ITN, rather than just adding a couple more sentences. Greyhood said the article was insufficiently updated thirty-six hours ago. Instead of fixing that problem, you've just argued and badgered me about it. Yeah, so what if the article is very long? If anything, that makes putting a sufficient update easier as it won't take up an undue percentage of the article. And if this is so significant, surely it warrants a more lengthy explanation than, I don't know, the fact that Iran didn't let two inspectors into the country last summer. I don't need to "be explicit". We have guidelines that specifically state how long the update needs to be. It doesn't even meet that. This seems to be a very significant development in Iran's nuclear program, but the supposed update does not communicate that. In fact, it communicates little more than the proposed blurb. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 08:31, 20 November 2011 (UTC)

Like I said, I don't think that's acceptable. If there's any standard to lower in times of drought, it's the consensus standard. Our goal, after all, is to showcase updated articles, not showcase articles that everyone wants on the Main Page. So, well-updated updates with borderline consensus should take precedence over poorly updated articles with unanimity. And about tables... don't your remember your high school science teacher who docked points for failing to put a caption and title for your tables? This is the equivalent. Yeah, these tables have titles, but you need some context, an explanation, a paragraph explaining what the tables just put in numbers. It's not so difficult to put that together.

**Adding to my reasoning, this action is expected and used often with protests on private property. Protestors were breaking the park rules (camping), repeatedly warned and asked to leave by police & owners, then arrested for trespassing. The temporary eviction, to clean and prevent further camping, is not startling. Note that the legal rationale for eviction is trespassing, as owners explicitly asked police to conduct the operation.
::I agree that these events are of diehard importance to a small group. This could qualify for ITN. However, the blurb now is heavily biased toward protestors. I would weakly support a blurb like "Occupy Wall Street protestors in NYC were temporarily evicted from Zuccotti Park by police for safety and trespassing violations," which is a neutral POV stating the fact, duration, and reason of eviction.

*'''Comment''' Look at our current ITN: we have one country-wide violent uprising that has been about to turn into a civil war for quite some time; three changes to major political players on three continents; one guy becoming the all-time greatest motorsport driver in world history; an extinction of a sub-species; and a minority topic from fine arts. Now just ask yourself: what has our New York's finest evicting 200 people from one place to another anything – just anything at all – to do with these other stories? It compares not even closely to them in significance, even if it is drummed by all media outlets 24/7. It might suffice as a counter-culture minority topic, but as counter-culture is almost always very much politically radical, I don't think that we, as an encyclopedia and a reference work, should dwell too deep down that road. I would be inclined to exclude anything having to do with political philosophy from the definition of a "minority topic," not only due to immerse problems with original research. It just somehow..  doesn't fit the dignity of an encyclopedia to post fresh news of (mostly young) people democratically protesting the police on its main page.

*'''Further Comment re:Hydrox''' It is worth understanding that Hydrox has nailed the issue on the head for this nomination and others. This eviction has been, gone, and disappeared in the night. It's already just another stale story amongst dozens (if not hundreds) in this on-going leaderless narrative that is the Occupy "movement". Wikipedia rightly gave prominence to the Arab Spring because the event had "Point A, Persons B and C, and Event D".  Occupy has got every letter of the alphabet in a bag and refuses to even lay then out for inspection. This story is, as Hydrox says, "200 people evicted from a public place". And that's it. There's nothing more to the story, so why put it on the front page? I would go so far as to suggest that all Occupy story nominations are automatically shut-down by way of WP:SNOW.

*'''Comment - the rules are wrong here''' This story is a real problem for ITN. There is a global movement happening, and it's now at the stage where many instances of that movement are being closed down by authorities. (It has happened in my city.) No single instance of a close down will satisfy ITN guidelines. The '''Opposes''' above are technically correct. The real news is the fact that it's happening in many places, more or less concurrently. But no news outlets are reporting on it that way. They are all looking locally. We are the '''GLOBAL''' encyclopaedia, but for us to somehow combine instances here would be classic [[WP:SYNTHESIS]], and totally unacceptable according to our rules. But it is happening, and it's significant. Our rules are preventing us from telling the real story here. I don't know the solution.

The Occupy Wall Street protest is the ''FLAGSHIP'' protest that inspired similar protests by countless ''thousands'' of protesters in literally ''hundreds'' of towns and cities in ''every country in the Western world'', and you cannot appreciate why this is "any different"?

:'''Comment''' I'm a bit dismayed by the wall of Opposes here. Several people here seem to be setting the bar for the inclusion of Occupy Wall Street on ITN way too high. Yeah, we don't need to post every development in this event, but we haven't. We posted about this a month and a half ago, and that's about it. Even then, people complained this wasn't of international significance (especially because the previous event was even more minor and fleeting), just a localized hippie-fest. When it went global in mid-October, that wasn't sufficient. And, now, with the New York flagship protest dramatically dismantled (and note the eviction has now been upheld by a judge), that's not good enough either. It's fine if you still think this hasn't met your standards, but, frankly, short of the protesters being murdered, it seems some people just don't want Occupy Wall Street anywhere on the Main Page, often because of dismay with the movement (lack of organization, unclear goals, etc.). Okay, I got that. You don't have to support the movement. You don't have to think their protest is effective. You don't have to think the people involved are productive members of society who can't afford to put their lives on hold for days or weeks on end. But, you can't deny that the protest, and particularly last night's incident, has received international attention, even if it's not the most important event, or among the fifty most important events, happening in the world right now. For the umpteenth time, this section is called ''In the News'', not ''What Should Be In the News''. So, while it's okay to oppose this nomination, please don't be so closed-minded to nominations related to Occupy Wall Street or celebrities or Theme X because you personally don't think they're meaningful -- especially with ITN as stagnant as it is now. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 02:30, 16 November 2011 (UTC)

:::: Yeah, I'm one of the guys who opposed this and yes, I've seen the threshold for ITN generally being pushed higher and higher over time. My personal guess for the reason is that notability being a subjective criteria, everybody has their own inherent bias and difference of opinion on how important a topic is, and when a nomination gets shot down for reason of lack of notability, this leads to situation where people think "You think X topic is not notable enough to cross the notability barrier? If that's where you are drawing the threshold, then I dont see how Y topic (which in my mind is far less significant than X topic) can cross that threshold." This has lead to the threshold being pushed further and further up with a something bordering on [[crab mentality]] preventing nominations from going through.

*'''Support''' Despite being carried daily my all the major media outlets in the western world for many weeks, the Occupy protests have been virtually ignored by ITN. Sadly, I suspect (read: know damn well) that there are a lot more personal politics behind the opposition to posts about the Occupy protests than honest assessment of the ITNworthiness of the Occupy nominations - the votes of some editors on these issues are more predictable than the rising of the sun.
*Golbez, Crispmuncher, etc, clearly, the use of the term "chemical agents" (which redirects to "chemical weapons") is rhetorical, bordering on hyperbole. As is the idiotic term "impact weapons". But, if you had done ANY reading on this matter then you would know that ''that'' is the ridiculous language used by law enforcement on the scene: "while officers used loudspeakers to warn protesters that anyone who resisted risked arrest and could be '''[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2011/11/2011111445038175195.html "subject to chemical agents and impact weapons"]."'''

**"ANY reading" Not my job. The article did not contain any reference to chemical anything so all I had to go on was the nomination; I had no reason to believe the hyperbole was caused by the police and not by the nom. When it was pointed out I clammed up but if you insist: I apologize for accusing the nom of hyperbole. (Though, it should have been contained in quotes, should it not?

::*I agree with you 100% that the phrase "chemical agents and impact weapons" should have been in quotes. Especially given the provocative nature of such language.

::Reason? [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 19:16, 13 November 2011 (UTC)

*'''Support''' This has been front page headline news in my part of the world for a day now. A name instantly recognised by all cricket fans who haven't just been sucked in by the frantic T20 trash. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 19:16, 13 November 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' Not a significant enough person, in my view. I agree that he was "one of the finest cricket writers of his generation" but I don't think that's enough. Also, about 60% of his biography is dedicated to controversies: [[Peter_Roebuck#1986_controversy]], [[Peter_Roebuck#Assault_conviction]], and the circumstances of his death. If he really was one of the greatest writers of his generation, a good biography would surely have more to say about it. --[[User:Mkativerata|Mkativerata]] ([[User talk:Mkativerata|talk]]) 19:26, 13 November 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''. I guess that Roebuck counts an internationally known figure, but not in recent years and not to the extent, IMO, that his death qualifies for ITN. Also, considering the circumstances of the death... --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 19:28, 13 November 2011 (UTC)
::By "circumstances of the death...", are you referring to his apparent suicide? Developing media reports suggest that it wasn't just your average suicide. And even if it was, should it stop us listing him? [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 23:20, 13 November 2011 (UTC)
:::Out of respect for the dead, I don't think we should go into it too much. But, reading media reports and our own article, people might read between the lines, rightly or wrongly, and make assumptions about Roebuck's personal life. we don't say anything that isn't sourced.

::::Oh, come on. There has been speculation about [[Michael Jackson]]'s death for the past two years, and we didn't stop posting about him.

*'''Not sure''': my gut says, "No, he's not important enough, no one outside of cricket would care". However, Roebuck is clearly "widely regarded as a very important figure in his or her field" (from [[WP:ITN/DC]]), that is, over 600 major cricket matches and one of the best known cricket writers of his generation. His death received attention in a number of countries over a number of days, so "lacks international significance" is hardly an argument.

*'''Comment''' - Historically and in contemporary criminological studies, drug sweeps decrease the crime rate in the short term, but in the long term cause a rebound that results in a return to the original crime rate (perhaps even slightly higher). This is why I would be hesitant to post a news story such as this as it most likely would have no lasting effect.

There were [http://stats.grok.se/en/201111/Joe_Paterno 85,000 hits] for [[Joe Paterno]] yesterday. Waiting until January when far fewer people are looking for information on this would be kind of dumb. By the way, by "winningest" they mean he's won more games than any other coach in major college football.

*'''Oppose'''  This is essentially a US domestic story, not of wider interest, so the bar has to be higher as a consequence, and we're not even talking about professional sport here.  Would this even be considered if it was the Oxford or Cambridge rowing teams?  I strongly doubt it and college sport doesn't get any higher profile than that.  The current headline is a mess and too broad a target to consider too.  Where is the main bold article?  We have no idea.  How then can we consider it?  At the very least the headline needs trimming for length and the number of links trimming.  The very last thing that should be done is wedge yet something else in as suggested above. If you have to link too many terms that implies a lack of familiarity with the story is expected from the users, in which case that surely weakens the very case for inclusion.

** I don't think that it being posted by an American, who I never seen edit any American sports articles, and who goes to a college that doesn't even have college football and has nothing to do with Penn State mattered. Plus consensus was forming that it was more than an typical American sports headline, with the administration of the university, which is one of the biggest in the U.S. put into question. If the same thing happened in Harvard or Cambridge, or any other "Major" world university that their administration is covering up a similar scandal that was formed by a notable faculty member, and controversy and major media coverage happens, it would have made ITN without any objections.

So, start with the perspective of an Australian who wouldn't expect a scandal in his country's BIGGEST sport to appear here. Why should this one about the US's fourth(?) biggest appear?

:::::It's been noted above several times that this is getting substantial press in Canada, which makes it "international" (which isn't a criteria anyway, but that's another issue).  Also, Jayron pointed out above and Johnsemlak below that this also involves the resignation of the president of one of the biggest and highest ranked universities in the world, which goes to my point that this isn't just about a major figure in the fourth biggest US sport resigning.

*Post-posting '''Oppose''': Sorry, but not a major thing outside the US. Websites from several countries can be listed, but that does not mean it has received prominent coverage there as a notable event. For example, an Indian website is quoted above, but this is practically a "Meanwhile, in the USA.."  story here in India.

:*"Not a major thing outside the US" is not in and of itself a valid criterion for an Oppose. The cancellation of a Sumo basho was not a major thing outside of Japan--it was still posted to ITN. I'm not posting this as a Support but I am seeing a lot of intellectually dishonest Oppose arguments. This is not just a report about a "football coach being fired"--the University President was also ousted and the Athletic Director and another administrator are under indictment for perjury. Also the idea that Penn State is "not a major university" is absurd on its surface. As for the Oxford or Cambridge rowing teams...if such a scandal resulted in the resignation or firing of an Oxford or Cambridge University President, then you can absolutely be sure that it would be proposed for ITN.

::* Completely agree. I was merely making a point that just because there is a news report from a country, that does not imply it has received prominent coverage in that country. And to respond to 184.57.25.123, "notability" is a criteria and if it is not generally notable outside a particular country, it gives a reasonable (may be not conclusive) estimation of its notability. If the allegation of intellectual dishonesty is directed at me (given that the quote was from my comment), I resent that - If my arguments are shown to be crap - I'll accept that they are crap, but not that they were intellectually dishonest. Because when I'm making them right now, I completely stand by them. As of now, I firmly believe that this is not notable to an international audience. Which is why I am opposing it.

*****:As our criteria clearly state, not notable outside the US is not grounds for exclusion.  The majority of arguments for oppose seem to focus on that point.  And, it's a dubious argument at best.  Almost nobody has actually bothered to cite evidence that it's not notable outside the US.  Mwalcoff and a few others posted very convincing evidence that the story is at least getting coverage in many places outside the US.  It really seems to me that many people living outside the US are reading 'I haven't seen coverage of this myself' as not notable outside the US.  I'll switch to '''support''' myself.  If it were just a college football story I might not feel that way but this is much bigger than that clearly.  We can debate how significant Pennsylvania State University is but it is a very large university at 45,000 on a single campus (are there stats on how that would rank worldwide, as a single campus?).  It's president (not some lower 'administrative bureaucrat') and an iconic and record-setting coach have both been fired and a deep and long-running pattern of [[child abuse]] has been revealed.

::The WSOP ME is a little different from Darts.  Most of the tournament is done in June-July.  Only the final table returns in November.  In theory this is supposed to build up suspense and minimize the lag between the game play and the results---it used to be that ESPN's coverage was 4 months behind so by the time ESPN broadcasted the winner everybody knew who it was.  By moving the final table to November, they hoped to accomodate ESPN to make it more prestigious. So they delayed the final table so that people wouldn't hear who won the event.  This year, for the first time, ESPN had near "live" coverage available online (15 minute delay).  Talk before the tourney was that online viewership might exceed 10 million in the US and another 10-20 million globably... but I can't find any numbers right yet.  As for some hit numbers, let's make sure we are talking apples to apples: for 2011 WSOP July 36K, June 20K... PLUS [[2011 World Series of Poker results]] 21K July and 20K in June... PLUS WSOP in June 201K and July 201K.  If you look at the staying power of the WSOP articles, you will see that they keep their numbers up (the dart articles drop down rapidly showing a lack of sustainability.)
::As for international flavor... 90 countries were represented at this tournament---about 1/3 of the Main Event were non-Americans.  International coverage is on the rise, with the WSOP issuing more international press credentials than ever before.  The final table (9 players) had 7 different countries represented.  4 of the 5 past WSOP champs have been non-Americans.
::Coverage exists outside the US, here are just a few of the searches that I did on "2011 WSOP", I could have possibly found more using other terms:

::I think that the present blurb does not describe the event in a proper way. It reads like an opening of some pipe in a German city, while in fact it is the world's longest submerged [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] spanning most of the [[Baltic Sea]], highly important for Russia and half of Europe. And we usually highlight the world records or at least the main technical parameters such as length when we post infrastructure items. Also, this is not the first or only opening and inauguration of the pipeline (though it is the main one), there was already an official opening/inauguration in September when Russia started piping technical gas into the pipe. That's the reasoning for my blurb:
:::''Russia starts commercial [[natural gas]] deliveries to Europe via the '''[[Nord Stream]]''', the world's longest submerged [[pipeline transport|pipeline]].''
:: I should notice that Beagel's blurb is also better than the present one, even though there were also representatives of France and the Netherlands, not only Russia and Germany, and it is better to avoid mentioning controversial controversy.

:::They are only semi-regular in that calving events occur once every few years. I'm getting somewhat variable reports on the size of this block: [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10764140 New Zealand Herald] puts it at 900 sq km, [http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/11/03/huge-crack-discovered-in-antarctic-glacier/ Fox News] at 880 sq km and the [http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2011/1104/Huge-chunk-of-Antarctic-ice-sheet-set-to-break-free Christian Science Monitor] at 780 sq km. FOX suggests that the last "significant" calving was in 2001, from which the space photos are available [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=1982 here], and the iceberg that calved was about 715 sq km. The exact size of this one is likely to be 800 - 850 sq km when it does calve, though I did forget to mention that the last calving actually took place [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071019102619.htm in 2007], with an area of about 680 sq km. Regular observations show calving events roughly every 5 &ndash; 10 years, though this latest one is (or ''will be'') the largest in more than 10 years. However, this particular glacier potentially merits more attention than the recent [[Mertz Glacier]] break-off (2,545 sq km), and perhaps even the [[Larsen B]] ice shelf collapse (3,250 sq km), simply because Pine Island Bay is one of Antarctica's biggest contributors to land ice loss. In 1995, it released about 2.6 cubic km of meltwater into the ocean per year, a rate with increased to 10.1 cubic km in 2006; the rate was 6 gigatonnes in 2005 (AP via NZ Herald) and increased to 46 gigatonnes sometime between 2007 and 2010 (see the article on glacier). My research indicates that the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] loses a total of 132 - 196 billion tonnes of meltwater per year, so the Pine Island Glacier alone contributes a significant sum of that, and this calving is likely to further increase melting. New discoveries continue to be made in the region, including [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=48637 this one] of a deep warm-water channel underneath the glacier in 2009. ~<font color="blue">[[User:AstroHurricane001|AH1]]</font>&nbsp;<sup>(''[[User_talk:AstroHurricane001|discuss]]!'')</sup> 03:05, 7 November 2011 (UTC)

::It is a key factor.  On previous long duration space flights the crewmember has been incapacitated on their return to Earth and in need of considerable physiotherapy to rebuild muscle mass, even with the orbital exercise regime.  A Mars mission involves a long-duration space flight followed by a landing on Mars and the crew are expected to be immediately capable to work.  Mars' gravity may be lower than Earth's but it is still quite strong and this is a big concern.  Not addressed here at all.  Neither are the risks of radiation or solar flares or other innumerable difficulties.  Instead people go on about psychological issues and how they would cope with technical difficulties in comparative isolation from Earth - difficulties that are purely an intellectual exercise in this experiment, but place the crew in mortal danger in a real mission.  However you spin this the experiment is far too limited to be of any practical relevance.  You can earn a lot more about these issue by studying other environments where people are isolated and in real rather than imaginary danger - in the Antartic, deep underground or on mountain tops for example.

*'''Oppose''' I have to say I was amazed this got posted too.  The criticisms of this exercise have been widely made, are substantial, and are not anywhere near as easily dismissed as it has attempted to be made out above.  The lack of gravity ''is'' a major shortcoming, as is the lack of danger: these invalidate large parts of the human factors that are the supposed goal of the project.  Even the crew is artificial - does anyone seriously suppose it would be politically acceptable to exclude women from the mission when hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars would have been spent on a real mission?  When you consider the large number of science stories that don't get posted this seems totally out of place.  In a hundred years who is going to care about the dubious results of this experiment in the slightest?

'''Comment''' I suppose the key article is [[2011 ASP World Tour]], that in its current shape is only a list of tables with a brief prose intro. We need substantial improvement of its content.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 17:50, 3 November 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' although there are plenty of surf wannabes all over the world, how many people are really interested in surfing as a spectator sport or take it seriously as a sport compared to something like cricket, rugby, baseball. Therefore I consider this a minority topic. My vote is based on that if this going to appeal to a wide scope of people which is what ITN is. [[User:Donnie Park|Donnie Park]] ([[User talk:Donnie Park|talk]]) 19:34, 3 November 2011 (UTC)

*'''Support''' Plenty of media coverage in my part of the world. Claiming this to be a minority sport obviously depends on one's persperctive. And Slater is an extraordinary standout in this sport.

*'''Support''' This protest reflects a dramatic escalation of events after local law enforcement sent in riot police using batons and tear-gas against an otherwise insignificant "occupy" sit-in by a relative handful of protesters. For those demanding a noteworthy trigger before posting an ITN item about the "occupy" protests, short of fatalities, it doesn't get much more noteworthy than this.

(Its been done several times before) If a new country puts a man in space, wouldnt it be notable? (Its been done several times before) If a new country develops an ICBM, wouldnt it be notable? (Its been done several times before). Or take the example I used before, when China puts a rover on the moon in 2013 or when India does it in 2014 .. are you saying these wont be notable? The reason for notability in all of these cases is that some technological achievements have thus far been possible only to a select countries. Another country being able to do it is major news.

But, the automated docking of a spacecraft with space station module "by a new country" is about as notable as a Somali goat-herder ''re''-inventing the wheel - all the Chinese had to do was send a few exchange students to [[MIT]] to "discover" how it should be done. As for this being ITN/R, the "launch of space stations or major components thereof" event occurred last week, and was posted accordingly. At best, this is a mere update of that event.

Only [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|nine]] countries can even conduct a space launch and only 3 countries do a space docking.

*:I well remember the NHL lockout in 04-05.  A league such as the NHL or the NBA cancelling a season outright is definitely a major story.  The NBA postponing the start of the season is on a level with Serie A postponing the start of its season due to a players strike.  Strikes and lockouts happen.  Seasons get shortened as a result.

I'm indifferent about whether this goes on ITN now or later, but it should be on ITN eventually. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 15:55, 2 November 2011 (UTC)
*:::::Fair enough.  I did lose track of the first comments in this thread.  Other than a cancellation of the season, the only other really logical point to post would be if there is a resolution to the lockout.  I'll admit to being on the fence over that, but since it is only hypothetical at this point, there is time to consider it.

*'''Oppose''' US-centric non-story about a minority sport. Not of interest to world-view audience. No notable personalities who would feature in a news story in their own right.

**I understand your point, but it's a bit harsh to call basketball a "minority sport". Quoting from the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11348053 BBC], basketball is the "world's second most popular sport, played in more than 200 countries, and a multi-billion dollar industry".

*'''Oppose''' per Doktorbuk. The only people who will care about this are the people who follow this ridiculous game, and we've had way too much sport in ITN as it is.

:::It's quite interesting that the season article [http://stats.grok.se/en/201109/UAAP_Season_74 college basketball league in the Philippines] got a ton more hits than the corresponding article about the [http://stats.grok.se/en/201105/2010%E2%80%9311_English_Premiership_%28rugby_union%29 English rugby union league].

*'''Comment:''' Seriously, the above two opposes are about as baseless as you can get, mostly per Jenks24. Deterence, I give you credit for your reasoning that there's too much sport on ITN (to be honest, I can halfway empathize with that sentiment), but I feel it's seriously undermined by the flagrant opposition to the sport itself more than the story. In my opinion, this story is not ITN material yet, but certainly will be if the entire season is cancelled.

:*I, too, would support an ITN nomination if the entire season is cancelled. But, I'm not going to support an ITN posting about routine industrial action, be it in the basketball industry or the airline industry.

*'''Oppose''' until the whole season gets canceled. I wanted that Qantas thing off of my Main Page when I saw it.

:'''Wait''' Whilst I think that a lockout in the most important competition in a globally-popular sport is indeed notable, and deserves a slot on ITN, is now really the best moment to do so? If it does get resolved before the end of the season, that would be a much better time for posting. And if it rumbles on so long that the whole season is cancelled, that too would be a more fitting moment.

* I also agree with Tariqabjotu that the NBA lockout deserves a ITN mention, either when it finishes and some games are saved or if the NBA season gets canceled, or both the season gets canceled and when the lockout ends. A lockout in the most significant league of one of the world's most significant sports has an economic and social impact towards the game themselves. Now is not the time to post though, I'll agree, but this isn't a U.S centric sport, it has the same consequence if the English Premier League ever goes on a lockout.
