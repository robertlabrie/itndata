The town of Pibor, capital of its county, has been attacked by one tribe seeking vengeance on another for attacks in August this year.  The [[Leu Nuer]] tribe attacked the town in spite of the presence of a battalion of UN troops and 800 men from the South Sudanese army.  Last week the same force set fire to the town of Linkuangol, and killed at least 40 people.

====Syrian Uprising Sticky====
News stories for this keep getting shot down because people are dying there every day, so no story is special enough. Lets put a sticky to [[2011–2012 Syrian uprising|Syrian Uprising]] to cover it all. [[User:Richard-of-Earth|Richard-of-Earth]] ([[User talk:Richard-of-Earth|talk]]) 07:22, 1 January 2012 (UTC)
*What kind of updates is the article getting? All I see in recent updates is in the casualty count, not about actual conflicts. Casualty counts are notable, but it is almost impossible to get anything encyclopaedic written about it, which means it is not Wikipedia's job to cover it. The problem, I think, is that we hadn't had anything nominated that can be considered a turning point or a single, influential event in the conflict. For example, we can nominate significant announcements or decisions by the Syrian opposition, the Syrian government, or other involved parties such as the Arab League and NATO. Those may be less concrete than the day-to-day fighting on the ground, but it is much easier to cover from an encyclopaedic/journalistic standpoint, and much easier to digest for readers. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 07:48, 1 January 2012 (UTC)
**I would normally agree to a sticky, but I can kind of see Jim's point. If the article isn't being updated with any content, there isn't really much point. '''<span style="font-variant:small-caps">[[User talk:Night w|<font color="black">Night</font><font color="gray">w</font>]]</span>''' 08:01, 1 January 2012 (UTC)
***Good point. How about the timeline then? The one for [[Timeline of the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising (September–December 2011)|September–December]] has gotten updated every day. The one for the [[Timeline of the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising (from January 2012)|new year]] has just been started. So the sticky would be so: [[Timeline of the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising (from January 2012)|Syrian Uprising]] [[User:Richard-of-Earth|Richard-of-Earth]] ([[User talk:Richard-of-Earth|talk]]) 10:57, 1 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I have to disagree with Jim. Over hundred thousand people engaged in demonstrations throughout Syria last week that was triggered by the arrival of monitors from the Arab League. However, the Syrian Army continued to fire at protesters and former soldiers in the presence of these monitors. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates&oldid=467081123#.5BReady.5D_114_people_killed_in_Syria_Monday My second to last ITN request] basically went stale in spite of support. I updated the article btw. I'm not so sure on a sticky.

*'''Comment''' Don't think it is a good idea. Most news from Syria are very dubious and disputed, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16372833 like this story with observers]. There are [[ketchup]] falsifications of killed persons for the news, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=EAU1n_apPEs like this], there are cases when alive people find themselves in the lists of killed, there are exaggerations and other kinds of informational war. Per Jim above, I suggest to nominate and report only important hard fact developments in the conflict, which are turning points or highly influential.

:Hmm, according to that list there are several longer with just the one pylon (though the Zhivopisny Bridge does use an arch rather than a single pylon), including the New Taipei Bridge which looks like it does indeed only have one pylon. But we don't have an article on it, and all I can see about it is in Chinese so I can't read it. Is it possible that the Taipei bridge opened after the discovery article used to support the record in the Ada Bridge article was written? Is there a reliable source for the record somewhere?

====Falklands====
This is a bump - ITN has been so slow that there's a [Ready] story which dropped off into the [[Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates/December 2011|December archives]]. The Falkland islands story is apparently good to go, and is dated 24 Dec, which would make it the fourth story on the template right now. I have no comment on the suitability of the item, but when there's a story from ''11 days ago'' on the template we have a problem.

*'''Oppose''' still because it's a largely symbolic. Uruguay has already stated it won't uphold the ban. If there is any news here at all it's that Brazil didn't oppose something which is in the interests of Argentina. What article was updated anyway? I can't find the details in Mercosur or Falkland Islands. --[[User:Stop China Now|Stop China Now]] ([[User talk:Stop China Now|talk]]) 19:16, 30 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Not to use a terrible pub........but that ship has sailed. It wasn't clear cut if the story should be posted in the first place and I'm sceptical about its ready status. In any case, it happened a long time ago, it's not clear cut what exactly has been agreed, and putting it on the ITN segment now would only act to make the segment rather out-of-date, inaccurate and misleading.

**'''Reconsider from a different angle''': No offence Vaibhav, but I think the proposed blurb focuses on the elephant dung while there is a goddamn elephant in the room. As I've mentioned above - I dont think Hazare's fast is notable enough, but the Lokpal Bill got passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] yesterday, if it gets passed in the [[Rajya Sabha]] as well (I think the vote will happen later today), then it will become law. If and when it becomes law, the Lokpal Act will be an important milestone in the Indian anti-corruption movement, and given India's status as the most populous democracy as well as one of the most corrupt countries, I'd think the new law would be notable enough.

Generally CC gateways charge a dispute fee to the merchant regardless of the outcome, so that each of these supposed donations will actually end up costing the charities money.

If the nomination is accepted, then [[Operette]] should be changed to [[Operetta]] which is the term we use in such articles as [[The Merry Widow]] as well as the article on Heesters himself. Also the article could be made less senstionalist by e.g. mentioning that he was Lehar's favourite Danilo - [http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/October%202005/53/783463/Some+highlights See here and be aware that there are an awful lot of character recognition problems] - and not just Hitler's.

*'''Comment''' It seems that the importance of the person is because of his life-span spent in the cinema, commencing at the time of silent film and ending in 2011. A slight consensus has been reached through the discussion and I must say that the opposes are groundless, since it surely won't be posted without further modification of the blurb.

*'''Comment''' ''"opposes are groundless..."'' Not exactly. Basically, this guy really isn't that well known.

**His death received a lot of media attention in many countries and in many languages. Since he died well over a thousend news articles have been written about the death of Johannes Heesters. In Germany he was a major star, receiving their Bambi prize (German equivalent of the Oscars) more then ten times. He held several Guinness World Records and while he may not be "universally known", he has received plenty of media attention outside of the German-speaking world already during his life. And, more so, in death. He probably has the longest running career of any movie actor or artist, living or dead, and he was a major star of the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

*'''Comment''' Nothing about this is a coincidence. Geology doesn't do coincidences. It's a sad follow up to three other earthquakes in the past 15 months in this advanced western city, all on a previously unknown fault line. By New Zealand standards it was previously regarded as a safe and geologically stable place to live. (A lot of NZ is not.) This actually parallels the [[Occupy movement]] where it's easy and probably valid to say that most of the protests, like this earthquake, are non-notable events in their own right, but what IS notable is the sum of the protests, or the sum of these earthquakes. Wikipedia doesn't handle these "cumulative" stories very well at all. My city in Australia is a very popular destination for people who have been leaving Christchurch in droves over recent months. This migration will only grow. We are watching the slow death of a city. That is notable, but I can't see our rules dealing with it.

*'''Comment'''. The blurb may be a little over-dramatic. Whilst the withdrawal of the ambassador and the freezing of political visits are not unnoteworthy, they don't really justify the phrase "cuts ties", IMO. Turkey is retaining diplomatic staff in France, has bilateral and other treaties with France (they are both in NATO, for example) and has not announced any economic or other sanctions against France. Also, the French ambassador does not appear to have been expelled from Turkey. And, as NW points out, this is not a "new law", but a private bill with a cat in hell's chance of actually becoming law. --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 00:59, 23 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' Just to clarify concerns raised above, "cuts ties" might be a non-moderate way of saying it but the degree to which bilateral relations have been damaged is pretty significant. According to Reuters link above: "''Erdogan called off all economic, political and military meetings with Paris and cancelled permission for French military planes to land and warships to dock in Turkey, marking a new low in relations between the NATO partners.''". I've changed law to bill and "cuts" to "severs" in the blurb. It's not adopted yet, since it has to go through the upper-house (French Senate) and yes political analysts predict that it's not going to pass but the important thing here is the political bargaining which caused the severing of relations. When it fails it the senate (if it happens), I doubt it's going to be a news story anymore and that's scheduled to happen in +6months time. --[[User:Tachfin|Tachfin]] ([[User talk:Tachfin|talk]]) 11:44, 24 December 2011 (UTC)

Think of it as an American soccer player with tremendous upside bought by Real Madrid for $50 million. Among those who had been "posted" only [[Ichiro Suzuki]] (think of him as the David Beckham of Japanese baseball) and [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]] had become legit MLB stars, so each player "posted" is not as straightforward as Ronaldo transferring to Real Madrid from Man Utd. While the record "post" may not be ITN material, this should put the "record" into perspective. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 17:46, 20 December 2011 (UTC)

}}
*'''Support''' - I haven't been on recently so I don't really know whether any Syrian uprising related news candidate(s) was posted but if not then this is the perfect incident to start posting about the uprising. 100 people killed in a single day by government forces is undoubtedly notable and significant. ''[[User:YuMaNuMa|YuMaNuMa]]''  <sup> [[User talk:YuMaNuMa|Talk]] [[w:Special:Contributions/YuMaNuMa|Contributions]] </sup> 05:34, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
*<s>'''Support''' As far as I know, we haven't posted anything about Syria for a while. Given the death toll, the conflict clearly continues to be notable. My only concern is that posting an item based on the stats "100 deaths in a day" seems a bit arbitrary. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 07:51, 20 December 2011 (UTC)</s> '''Oppose''' per Tachfin. I did not realize we regarded opposition sources as RS. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 10:10, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' because 1) People are killed in Syria everyday 2) I've heard reports of much lower numbers (~10) 3) The only reliable sources in your nom (AP) says " '''Activists said''' security forces killed up to 70 army defectors Monday as they were deserting their military posts near the Turkish border. At least 30 other people died in other violence across the country, '''the activists said''' " So this is just activists having fun by dramatizing stuff to foreign media happens everyday and everywhere. --[[User:Tachfin|Tachfin]] ([[User talk:Tachfin|talk]]) 09:12, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
**By that logic, all death toll figures reported by governments or civilians in civil wars are invalid and serve no purpose other than to dramatise a cause, and it will be obvious that the Syrian government forces will attempt to abate the death toll and circumstance in the region. We cannot simply continue to ignore the situation in Syria, you will not get an exact death toll figure until a government reform transpires or when a neutral force enters Syria.

***Situation in Syria is critical there is not doubt about that, but that's nothing new. A better story might be "Syria accepts 100 Arab League monitors amid continued violence in the country" since this is the only new development. The numbers of deaths should be attributed to those who made the claim (as RS do) but that would be awkward in the blurb and I find it uninteresting since everybody knows that there is violence and casualties in Syria since quite some months now. Even the different activists groups do not agree on a number (some say 38, 100, 140 yesterday it was 12). --[[User:Tachfin|Tachfin]] ([[User talk:Tachfin|talk]]) 11:05, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
****Agreed. I would support posting ''something'' about Syria - such as what Tachfin suggested above. But not some impossible-to-verify casualty count. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 03:42, 22 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Tachfin, I understand your concerns but unfortunately the heavy absence of independent journalists in Syria makes it nearly impossible for news organizations to confirm facts themselves. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16258387 BBC] appears to accept the claims made by the activists and I don't see any challenges in the source.

**BBC reported a claim made by the opposition, as is their duty. But I think the ITN has somewhat higher standards with regards to notability, which means it will be difficult to post ''allegedly significant'' events like this. Not to mention that the Syrian opposition doesn't exactly have a perfect track record with regards to reliable claims (which is no better and no worse than any other party in an ongoing civil conflict). <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 10:15, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
:::Foreign journalists are '''banned''' in Syria. A lot of the sources in the original [[2011 Syrian uprising|article]] are predicated on info fed from opposition movements and activists to rights organizations (Amnesty International) and the media. If it makes editors more comfortable, blurb could start with..."Activists report 100 killed blah blah." I'd like to hear the other numbers Tach is speaking of.

*'''Comment''' -<strike> How about we simply aggregate all death toll reports since the onset of the uprising and include the incident which occurred today, probably something along the lines of, 'The syrian uprising continues with an estimated *** casualties since the onset of the uprising in February, on December 19 ** civilians and protesters were killed making it one of the highest single day death tolls reported.'

'''Regarding quality of updates''': As I've done several times before, I'm quoting the ITN criteria page, with added emphasis on relevant parts:"''Candidates for ITN are evaluated on two main grounds: the quality of the updated content and the significance of the developments described in the updated content. In many cases, qualities in one area can make up for deficiencies in another. For example, <u>a highly significant event</u>, such as the discovery of a cure for cancer, <u>may have a sub-par update associated with it, but be posted anyway</u> with the assumption that other editors will soon join in and improve the article.''" I'll concede this doesn't hold up to the discovery of a cure for cancer, but if we have a consensus that the notability is high enough to have a sub-par update, then we should go for it ... this is a community project, not a service ... if there is a highly notable event, people should come to the page and if they are disappointed with the volume/quality of the updates, they can make the necessary changes. The above is just for those who think the update is not adequate and without prejudice to the quality of the update (I've looked at the article right now, and I'm happy with the 8-sentence well-referenced paragraph).  [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 11:12, 19 December 2011 (UTC)
:The current update is two sentences plus two references. That is itself sub-par. It's just about allowable because of the significance of the news. But having ''no update at all'' is certainly not sufficient, and I agree with Tariq that items should ''never'' be added to the template until the article has been updated. Those two sentences could have been added in barely any more time than it takes to add a support !vote here; posting should have waited until the article had been updated.

::Without indicating my own view on the content of the posting and article themselves, pulling something that has already been posted is a necessarily troublesome action. My understanding of Wikipedia's mentality is that editors are strongly urged to ''fix'' problems first, and ''remove'' problems as a last resort (with a few notable exceptions like BLP). If Tariq had either A) updated the article himself with the information that I think he himself said was quick and easy to post, or B) posted a warning that if the article wasn't suitably updated in, say, 10 minutes then it would be pulled, he would have gotten a lot less backlash. It should be obvious that what some might consider 'blind' adherence to the guidelines in the face of strong consensus to the contrary is going to cause problems. There are less confrontational ways to deal with situations like this than the one Tariq chose to pursue. [[User:TechnoSymbiosis|TechnoSymbiosis]] ([[User talk:TechnoSymbiosis|talk]]) 23:41, 19 December 2011 (UTC)
:::1. Please see [[WP:BRD]].  Tariq fixed the problem by removing the inappropriate item (which was ''very'' poorly written, incidentally).  The suggestion that it was his responsibility to "[update] the article himself with the information" (most of which probably wasn't even available yet), is absurd.  Likewise, I see no basis for the proposed ten-minute grace period.  How is it preferable to temporarily retain a premature item (thereby doing a disservice to readers) instead of simply pulling it, with the understanding that it will be restored when the article is sufficiently updated (i.e. creating the situation that should have existed in the first place)?
:::2. There was no [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]], let alone a strong one, to post the item '''immediately'''.  To someone who bothered to actually ''read'' the discussion and examine the article (instead of tallying the bold votes and ''blindly'' inserting a problematically worded blurb), it was clear that there was consensus to post the item ''after'' the necessary update occurred.  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 00:10, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
::::I didn't say it was Tariq's responsibility to update the article himself, I said that it was one of the options available to him that would have achieved a better reaction from other editors. Tariq equally could have not done anything at all. I'm familiar with BRD, but we differ on our reading of consensus in this thread. I think it's clear that a number of contributors wanted this item posted as soon as possible (and stated as much), whereas prior to the original posting, only one editor had indicated he wanted it posted 'after an update'. It appears to me that a reasonable interpretation of consensus was to post.

::::The rest of your reply is plainly unnecessary aggression that isn't worth addressing. I maintain the stance I described in my reply above: Tariq had a number of options for how to approach this situation, and he chose the one assured to attract the most negative response, after which he throws his hands in the air and complains that he doesn't need this crap. This is not an isolated incident, this is something that has happened frequently, and indeed exists on the current revision of this page more than once.

:::::Here on ITN at least we do not make decisions by mob mentality (just as we do not do so on [[Talk:Republic of China|content articles]]). We follow community guidelines that have been decided through years of debate between experienced members of this project. I am not one of them, but I have enough sense to trust their judgment, and their judgment clearly says that 1. ITN serves more than the purpose of simply reporting breaking news events; and 2. A minimum update of 5 sentences is almost always necessary to provide enough details for readers on Wikipedia. Frankly, if editors negatively responded to Tariq in this case, that's their own frigging problem.

After all, [[WP:STONE|nothing is set in stone]] on Wikipedia, at ITN or anywhere else. Consensus can change, decisions can change, policies can change. I agree that it would be more appropriate to take up issues with the criteria itself at the page for those criteria, but is there a problem with the criteria, or just how some editors are interpreting it? Let's take a look.
::::::You said "ITN serves more than the purpose of simply reporting breaking news events", and you're right. Your original line before you edited it, that ITN is not for beraking news, was too severe. [[WP:ITN#Purpose]] identifies two criteria that applied here. "To help readers find and quickly access content they are likely to be searching for because an item is in the news", and "To emphasize Wikipedia as a dynamic resource". You also said "A minimum update of 5 sentences is almost always necessary to provide enough details for readers on Wikipedia", but this contradicts the wording of the guidance, which says "a five-sentence update (with at minimum three references, not counting duplicates) is generally '''more than sufficient''', while a one-sentence update is highly questionable" (emphasis mine). This does not say '5 sentences is generally the minimum', it says '5 sentences is more than enough'. At the time this entry was posted, it had 3 sentences and 2 sources, certainly more than the 'highly questionable' threshold in the guidance.
::::::I think your interpretation here is stricter than intended. The article had an update, it wasn't great (but how many paragraphs can you write on a notable person's death when it didn't involve [[Muammar Gaddafi|bottom-poking]] or [[Osama bin Laden|dubious CIA operations]]?) and the admin may have looked at the part at [[WP:ITN]] where it says "For example, a highly significant event [...] may have a sub-par update associated with it, but be posted anyway with the assumption that other editors will soon join in and improve the article", decided that this article meets that criteria (which it certainly has, given the number of edits to it after it was posted) and been in the right to do so.

Sometimes, like in the case of The Moose, I chalk it up to lack of involvement with ITN; I don't recall seeing him or her ever post a blurb on ITN, but as in the past, admins often choose very big news stories for their first foray into ITN -- and thus become livid and perplexed when told that's not how things are done. That's not necessarily the case with Prodego; I think I've seen him around here.

* The [[Death and funeral of Kim Jong-il]] article is an embarrassment. There is little on his death &ndash; hardly surprising that his death is shrouded in as much secrecy as his life and his health. Most of the article was a simple cut-and-paste from the bio &ndash; such a waste of space (I've now taken the [[WP:BOLD|bold]] step of removing it). What follows below is a hardly encyclopaedic &ndash; a collection of comments and "sweet nothings" that encourages editors to post more of the same, thus perpetuating the cycle of unencyclopaedic content. What this article needs is real analysis from observers and pundits about the impact on his death. In the meantime, the article should be redirected back to the bio.--<small>[[User:Ohconfucius|<span style="color:Black;font:bold 8pt 'kristen itc';text-shadow:cyan 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em;">Ohconfucius</span>]] [[User talk:Ohconfucius|<sup>¡digame!</sup>]]</small> 02:25, 20 December 2011 (UTC)

:::Yes. Exactly what I mean. Comments like "President Alexander Lukashenko sent his condolences to Kim Jong-un over his father's death" don't strike me as being encyclopaedic, particularly if there are going to be more than three of those in the article.

I didn't realize that my actions had sparked this much discussion. Yes, I did read the comments here before posting the update. In fact, I used the blurb that was suggested here, with a minor change. No-one had objected to it. The article looked properly updated to me. I have participated here before, and it was that previous participation that pushed me to post the update when I did, because the bureaucracy that takes place here often allows postings to be held up for way too long (Ted Kennedy's death being the main example I can think of.) I did not see a request to hold the item, or any obvious concerns about the item. If there was one, I apologize. As for my "bullshit explanation for [my] action", I never provided an explanation for my action until now. (Check my contributions.) I'm sorry for my actions, and I won't post any more items.

*'''Support & Explanation''' I think it could be helpful to clarify that this is about [[Team handball]], an Olympic Sport and a sport very popular in Europe. It's played between teams of seven people. It's not about the less formally organised games involving two or four people played at times in the USA and Australia. It's a pretty serious game.

**Eh I'd argue men's team handball is very appropriate for ITN, dunno about the women's championship. 4,000 people watch the final at an 11,000-capacity arena; even on matches were the hosts (Brazil) played, the arena was never half-full. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 20:04, 19 December 2011 (UTC)
***I've looked at a couple of past tournaments to see if attendances for this sport are usually so low.  If you look at [[2005 World Women's Handball Championship|Russian 2005]], attendances were in the 100s until the semifinals (except for matches with Russia which were around 2-3 thousand).  The semifinal matches were in the 1000s, and the final, won by Russia, had an attendance of 10000.  If you look at [http://www.ihf.info/IHFCompetitions/WorldChampionships/WomensWorldChampionships/XVIIIWomenWorldChampionshipFRANCE2007/FixturesandResults/tabid/1734/Default.aspx France 2007], attendances of all quarterfinals matches and onward were 9000 or more.  Some earlier matches, not involving the host nation, were in the 1000s.  If you look at [[2009 World Women's Handball Championship|China 2009]] attendances were in the 100s (or lower) until the semifinals, which were 6000 each.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 03:14, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
****I'm pretty sure those were not sellouts, unless those arenas had capacities of less than 10,000.

*****Well, the 2007 final at the [[Palais_Omnisports_de_Paris-Bercy]] did have the full capacity of 14,000 apparently.  However, the 2005 final in the [[Ice Palace Saint Petersburg]] only attracted 10500 spectators, short of the 12500 capacity, and that's with the home nation in the final.  The 2009 final at the [[Nanjing Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium]] appears to have sold out at 13000 spectators.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 03:48, 20 December 2011 (UTC)

Manchester United are the 2010-11 English champions; they did not need to win the Community Shield to prove that, and had they lost their claim to the title would have been unchanged.

*'''Oppose'''. Some of the soapboxing and ungrounded allegations of U.S.-bias made me think twice about my neutral stance on this nomination. There is no reliable source whatsoever saying that the police shot dead 14 civilian protesters. Even if you believe completely in the story given by the opposition parties, it was unemployed oil workers who, after six months of being ignored in their demands, went on a stage and began pushing officials aside and destroying the speakers. That was how the riots got started - there was no political element in it whatsoever. See videos of the incident: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_rkaXetM0 beginning of the riots], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpWy7tInZ-U Riots continued]. And the riots from the unemployed oil workers, which were restricted to the single city, have completely died down by today, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbWRiu5dxzg with rioters arrested by the police] and facing trial. To quote a famous comment, this is local news of no international significance. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 23:57, 18 December 2011 (UTC)
::What soapboxing? What "allegations of U.S.-bias"?  These claims are unfounded. ''While government officials said 11 people died as a result of Friday's violence'' [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16231305 BBC] ''At least 10 people have been killed as striking oil workers clashed with government forces in a town in western Kazakhstan, officials say.''

Youtube fails WP:RS and WP:OR forbids primary sources. The BBC on the other hand easily fulfills both requirements. Again, the "worst violence in the Central Asian nation's recent history", per the BBC. Certainly noteworthy. To quote an equally famous reply: "You gotta be kidding me here. Read the third point of the '''"Please do not..."''' guidelines above." --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 00:20, 19 December 2011 (UTC)
:::The government claimed that 11-14 people died in the riots. It did not claim that the police shot dead 11-14 civilian protesters. That was my point. Your feigned inability to comprehend simple sentences is making me doubtful of your good faith. And by "allegations of U.S.-bias" I refer to this sentence: "If this had happened anywhere in Europe or the Americas it would be front page on ITN already.". Please refer to the fourth point above: "Do not accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due a to personal bias (such as ethnocentrism)".  <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 00:34, 19 December 2011 (UTC)
::::Ok so two things. 1) "At least 10 people have been killed as striking oil workers clashed with government forces" was pretty clear to me. Lets try "At least ten people have died in fighting between police and demonstrators" [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kazakhstan/8961356/Ten-die-in-fighting-between-police-and-demonstrators-in-Kazakhstan.html Telegraph] I sincerely doubt they all had traffic accidents on the way home. 2) Where did I accuse specific editors of bias? I didn't. I don't think the geographic location of the country suffering violence should matter, if violence is generally unusal in that country (as established by the BBC). I made that remark in response to the comment: "protests, riots and civil confrontations are not rare in most of the world, and especially not in Central Asia". Violence is rare in Europe and America, and according to reliable sources it's rare in Kazakhstan. So what soapboxing? --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 00:46, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Strong Speedy Support''' totally unprecedented in China. ''A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault.''

**It surely is not unprecedented; see [[List of civil disturbances in the People's Republic of China (2011)]]. This particular protest has been going on for three months, with villagers stopping their protests numerous times and some of them returning afterwards (it heated up most recently because a village official died under custody). And no, this is not a siege; there is no military, no city, no fortress, no conquest, and no assault, so I have no idea why you thought that definition would apply (is this another one of your jokes?). Well, you could consider the police encirclement "attrition", but just today they let in hundreds of people carrying food and supplies. Doesn't sound that exciting now, does it? Trust me, I know people there; this is not going to be the revolution that the Western media and liberal do-gooders has been clamoring for. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 13:00, 16 December 2011 (UTC)
***This is not "protestors in a park". They ran their fascist government dictators out of town on a rail, so yes, it is unprecedented, and you know it is.

****More bullshit. Wukancun is not a city, it is a village near the county-level city of Lufeng in Shanwei. And MSS is not a paramilitary organization; it is an agency of the state, and [[monopoly on violence|by definition]], is considered police.

******The definition helpfully given to us by the IP says: ''A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault.'' There is no military blockade (it's a police encirclement, and that's entirely different - compare the recent Brooklyn bridge encirclement to [[Waco siege|this]]); there is no city or fortress but rather a rural village; and there is no attrition and no preparations for assault. In other words, it is the complete opposite of anything described as a siege. Seriously, I'm pretty liberal when it comes to using descriptions, but this is borderline ridiculous. Not even the most pro-democratic news sources outside mainland China (Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Singapore, San Francisco) are referring to it as a siege. They all refer to it as a police encirclement of a protesting village, and that might have been worth posting if it did not have sensationalism and exaggerations plastered over it. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 20:04, 16 December 2011 (UTC)
*******The difference between a "city or fortress" and a 20,000-inhabitant village is taking the definition too pedantically IMHO. The intent of conquering by attrition or assault: most of the sources crystalball that the PRC government intends to retake the village rather than allow the village to secede - these predictions are for RS's to decide, not Wikipedians. As for police vs military, again, although [[wiktionary:siege|the wiktionary]] could potentially become an encyclopedic level study of usage frequency of every subtly different usage of a word in an individual entry, i think that saying that it's not a siege because the police are not military is also an overly strict interpretation of the wiktionary entry. As for RS usage, which overrides the above subtleties of Wikipedian judgment: [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8960078/Wukan-siege-the-fallen-villager.html Wukan siege: the fallen villager], [http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2011/12/wukan-honors-martyr-amid-siege/ Wukan Honors Martyr Amid Siege].

*************The current article (and whatever blurb you guys can come up with) are unlikely to educate anyone. "Police and Communist Party officials were forced out of the village, which then became self-administered...The Hindu said that Wukan village became "entirely controlled and administered by its residents" and that this was "a likely first in China's modern history." Villages in Guangdong have been self-administered since the early 1980s. That's 30 years ago, and there are two hundred villages in Lufeng alone, all self-administered. "Under the government's internet censorship program, internet searches related to Wukan, and the cities of Shanwei and Lufeng were blocked after the December uprising started." - Not true, at least not now.

**"threw out the Communist Party and police and replaced them by their own elected representatives". You're incorrect. Wukan is a village, and village representatives (村委會) are elected (now you know why there's a difference between a village and a city), although the transparency of that election is of course in doubt. In fact, this is one of the main concerns of the protest: villagers want to improve the democratic process. Any talk of them throwing out "state-appointed overseers" is just bullshit. They may be corrupt, and they may have rigged the elections, but they're ''not'' appointed by Beijing. In fact, Beijing and the provincial government of Guangdong are both considered potential allies of the villagers against the corrupt local government in Lufeng/Shanwei. This is not a semantic debate; it's crucially important that we get these facts right, because this section will lose a LOT of credibility if we put up something so erroneous and ridiculous that it is akin to claiming "the U.S. marines are besieging Oakland protesters".

* '''Oppose''' as a routine event of local significance. Per Jim Sukwutput, some media are just sensationalizing this and drawing grandiose inferences. Despite what 76.18.43.253 says, this is not a revolt against the Chinese government or against communism; it is a protest against supposedly corrupt local officials. In fact, the villagers [http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/censors-12142011132231.html are appealing] to Beijing to "save" them from their erstwhile municipal government. Also, to address what Boud is saying, village heads are directly elected in China, and [http://books.google.com/books?id=5xNFljYInp4C&pg=PA107 about 40%] of such heads are not Communist Party members.

They've used the moniker "just a village", well fine, in the "PRC", it's a "village", but this is en.wikipedia.org not cn.wikipedia.org, and 20,000 people is simply not what readers of the English WP would consider a village. Land protests are common, fine, but this is not a common protest. The truly rabid opposition to posting this story is a shining example of the failings of ITN. Today there are two dead authors on the main page, while in Wukan there is a city under restricted access from state controlled law enforcement. For shame. --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 18:14, 18 December 2011 (UTC)

*<s>Oppose new blurb as well.</s> I don't know what the hell happened with the blurb, but it's still incorrect. There is no evidence that the local village officials were members of the Communist Party of China. As someone helpfully pointed out, only 60% of village officials are CPC members, and so far I have not seen a source which states that the evicted officials are all part of the 60% (I don't think conclusive evidence can be had either way; CPC membership data is confidential). Let me note that I am ''still'' opposed to the blurb even if this error is corrected; I'm just noting that as of now there are not just neutrality/soapboxing issues with the articles and the blurbs but also factual inaccuracies which make it absolutely impossible to post. I am also astounded that the nominator continues to make careless errors such as this when numerous users have provided him plenty of information concerning this topic, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5xNFljYInp4C&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q&f=false with reliable sources to back them up]; I guess this just shows the kind of attitude prevalent amongst some in this project - do everything to get the nomination to succeed, plaster sensationalism all over it, and fuck the facts. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 22:31, 19 December 2011 (UTC)
**Jim: there was no old blurb, so "as well" and "''still'' opposed" don't apply. ''Now'' i have proposed a new blurb ''after'' your latest (22:31, 19 December 2011 (UTC)) comment. The nominator, la Goutte de pluie, forgot to or wasn't aware of how to use the ITN template. This is my first time on ITN/C (AFAIR), and i didn't know the procedure at all. i used the template after noticing that a long discussion happened without the template, making it difficult for neutral third parties to judge what to do. It also made it difficult to consense on the wording of the blurb, since there was no blurb. Since you seem to have more ITN/C experience than me, it would have helped if you had pointed out that the de facto nominator or someone else should post the ITN template. That would have helped focus the discussion.
**You have made many claims without showing in which [[Wikipedia]] articles these claims are RS'd. i have put in a link to [[Organic Law of Village Committees]], since that seems to be a main theme that you are referring to. At the moment, that article is purely theoretical: it refers to the law but has no RS stating typical percentages of elected village councils that are CP members, the degree of independence from the CP, or to what degree the elections are really free and fair, whether the individuals and political parties that tend to win the elections are mostly left-wing, right-wing, pro-workers, pro-business, anarchist, socially conservative, socially liberal, pro-religious, secular, ethnic-based, or whatever. I would presume that many of them would be more or less associated with regional or national level political parties, assuming that you are right about the lack of a CP monopoly. In the interests of the Wikipedia, it would be great if you could work on [[Organic Law of Village Committees|that article]] about which you apparently know a lot, providing RS.
**In any case, please tell us if you still have any problem with the blurb version as of 09:51, 20 December 2011 (UTC). Please also remember [[WP:GOODFAITH]]. It might be difficult sometimes, but it's critical to making Wikipedia work :).  [[User:Boud|Boud]] ([[User talk:Boud|talk]]) 09:51, 20 December 2011 (UTC)
***You're correct, there was no old blurb, and I was confused. As for RS concerning village officials, I did link to a book on Google Books in my comment above. It contains some data about percentage of non-CPC village officials, which varies a lot across the country but is typically around 40%. I think it's safe to say that it's highly unlikely that the local officials in Wukan were all members of the CPC, and so far I have not seen any source claiming that this is true. User:Shrigley made a similar point above. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 10:23, 20 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' apart from a nonsensical book, this guy has a far amount of notability; I would post the death of ''really'' notable authors, who ''really'' influenced future writers; he did not influence ''anyone'', maybe except atheists. His biased books are not at all educational, but more brainwashing. If you think I am against Atheism, then I say "no".

**You sound angry. Political authors are not under an obligation to be "unbiased". They're ''supposed'' to offer their own points of view. On the other hand, we on Wikipedia and especially ITN do try to be objective when evaluating the notability of a nomination, and not resort to insults such as "brainwashing" against individuals who recently passed away.

::Hitchens is one of those people who is very hard to categorise. He has been a writer and journalist for over 40 years, with interests covering a huge range of topics.

**I was implacably opposed to posting this article. But pulling it is a cowboy move, for which you are becoming increasingly well known around these parts. The admin who posted it was well aware that the update was marginal, but he considered it postable nonetheless. Who are you to revert on the basis that your judgment is preferable? Wikifan and Johnsemlak have made entirely valid points that the material on his death is sufficient in the context of the material on his illness. Did you consider those points? Or would you have us hurt an otherwise pretty good article by including four useless sentences of padding about his death? --[[User:Mkativerata|Mkativerata]] ([[User talk:Mkativerata|talk]]) 19:47, 17 December 2011 (UTC)
***I share the same concern. Some things require a context and hence a detailed update; but everybody knows what dying entails, and there isn't anything other than padding that you could put on about it. I understand that we have a standard to enforce, but the policy states that "five-sentence update is '''generally''' considered the minimum", and this seems to me to be one case where the policy clearly does not apply. Besides, there is an entire section devoted to his cancer and death, many of which are fairly recent materials. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 19:53, 17 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' Yeah, what's the deal Tariq? It's pretty obvious there is not a lot one can update other than he suffered from cancer, and later died from his illness. And there is more than one paragraph devoted to this issue. The threshold does not require the sentences relating to the update need to be consecutive. That football guy that no one knew in the US was posted without challenge. This guy is an international figure.

:{{ec}} Fine, I'll repost it. This isn't worth the harassment. No, HiLo, there was no ulterior motive, although somehow I'm not surprised by your assumption of bad faith. The update was and is poor and I continue to hold the idea that no story important enough to go on ITN can't have more than one sentence said about it. Weren't a couple people saying condolences were coming from several notable figures? Not mentioned in the article. This story isn't even one of those "everyone's talking about it, so put it on ITN story"; people here are rather divided, unlike, for example, on the World Cup opening or Steve Jobs' death. So, I'm not sure why someone felt so rushed to put this up, and why twenty-four hours wasn't enough time to get more than a "He died." into the article. But, as I said, this isn't worth the harassment, and if this is what the lynch mob wants, yeah, okay. I feel it should be the admins' job to hold the section to its original intended purpose (perhaps that's why most of the other sections have official or unofficial directors), but clearly I'm alone in this philosophy. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 22:29, 17 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''.  I don't think Tariq can or should be blamed for pulling it when he thought he had grounds on the basis of an insufficient update, which several editors did comment on.  Yes, I supported this on the basis that material concerning the last few months of his life could be considered part of the 'update', but I can easily see how someone would view it differently.  If an admin feels an article does not meet the criteria, they can pull it irregardless of the number of supports for it.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 04:29, 18 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''SUGGEST PULL'''.  Even though arguably notable, it does not come close to a top five headline news section. The "In the News" section is at the VERY least implicitly a top five headline news section, and though Hitchens death is notable, it is not a top five news story. I suggest immediate removal from in the news. As an addendum of opinion, I believe there is some soft positional and idealogical steering by those who want Hitchins' death displayed on "In the News", thereby obliquely inconsistent with Wikipedias' policy of neutrality.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:John11235813|John11235813]] ([[User talk:John11235813|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/John11235813|contribs]]) 05:00, 18 December 2011 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
*:To cover your two objections.  1) It's not a 'top 5 headline'.  I'd broadly agree that generally that's the kind of headline that makes ITN, but there are plenty of stories that make ITN that are not such headlines (e.g. elections).  If we look at our [[Wikipedia:In_the_news#Deaths|criteria for deaths]], I think Hitchens does meet #2: ''The deceased was widely regarded as a very important figure in his or her field.''.  He's been frequently compared with George Orwell.  Also, add to the fact that he died near the peak of his career (ITN prefers that to notable deaths from old age long after their careers) and he had written pieces only 1-2 weeks previously.  2).  Some of the supports are POV.  I would agree that at least a couple of supports were POVs in favor of Hitchens, but the majority weren't.  As I said above, Hitchens clearly was one of the most significant journalists in the field, regardless of his political beliefs.  As a practical matter, also, Hitchens was hard to categorize politically as he had strong views on both the left and the right side of the political spectrum.  It's hard to imagine that many WP editors shared Hitchens' views on everything.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 08:45, 18 December 2011 (UTC)

:::::Ah, yeah, I see where you're coming from; when combat operations ended last year, some sources initially called it the end of the war, some avoided doing so, the US government didn't, and overall the media continued to treat the war as ongoing. At the Iraq War article, we made the mistake of going with the sensationalist "war is over" sources and, thanks to a couple of uncompromising users, it took something like 6-8 months before we were able to agree to change it back. But this looks like a different situation. All the reliable sources I can find are universally calling the Iraq War over. Yes, violence continues in Iraq, but whether any sources will treat that as a continuation of the "Iraq War" remains to be seen (I don't see any indication that they will, not that it matters, since we're not making that declaration in the blurb).

:::John: I agree with you on the general readability and over-emphasis on science in (essentially) a current affairs article. But probably some scientists have been editing it who would look at you agog if you said that to them. And, at the end of the day, I don't think it bars it from ITN. The update could still do with more. For example, there has been a lot of comment from other counties and notables on the withdrawal ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16165033]) and I think that should be represented. --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 23:47, 13 December 2011 (UTC)

That being said, I'm really shocked that people think these are two completely unrelated events. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] article even mentions that a Canadian minister noted that the new idea out of Durban would be a better way forward. The blurb isn't saying that the Canadian withdrawal was ''because'' of what happened in Durban (or vice versa); it simply mentions that they're two related ideas -- "coincidental" or not. Elections in one country generally have no connection whatsoever to elections in other countries and are almost never, if ever, mentioned in another country's election article. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 23:45, 14 December 2011 (UTC)

*If we're posting this again, let me state that I also oppose a merge. It's true that these events are related, but if we put these events in the same blurb, we run the risk of seemingly ''emphasizing'' this connection when this itself is a controversial political issue (it is not considered proper to pull from one treaty in the prospect of having another agreement). Furthermore, I see no need for putting them on the same blurb; each event is important enough on its own. (For the record, I did oppose the merge before the nomination was posted, but my comment was accidentally removed by another user.) <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 02:56, 15 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Post pull opinion''' And this is why ITN has been so slow recently ;)  I continue to support merging the two stories into one blurb. There is an obvious connection between the two - but not SYNTH-like. The Canadian decision happened whilst the agreement was made elsewhere. There is an obvious and relevant connection between the two. Wiki does not have hard and fast rules on precedent which forbids news stories being connected in this way. It might be a good precedent to start. [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 04:04, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
**Neither are there rules for such stories to be merged, and so far eight editors had argued against the merger (as opposed to four in support). It is however sad to see that a news item of such global relevance is stalled, while a local lunatic can make it to the front-page in minutes. --[[User:Elekhh|Elekhh]] ([[User talk:Elekhh|talk]]) 04:15, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
***{{ec}} Again, numbers, especially when considering remarks after the fact, should be taken with a grain of salt. I would not be surprised if, had the blurbs been kept separate, a couple people would have come here asking why two related stories aren't just combined (or why one didn't replace the other), especially since they would likely be on ITN one below the other. The rationale against it is highly enigmatic to me. "We don't do it for elections" is a straw-man argument, and we frequently merge related blurbs together (e.g. during the Arab Spring protests at the beginning of the year) when there is an obvious connection. So, this is hardly without precedence. Some seem to argue that this is coincidence, but FormerIP, who still thinks the blurbs should be separated, acknowledges that this is probably not the case. So, I don't understand what the issue is. That we don't want to imply something that isn't explicitly said anywhere? That we don't want to bold two articles in one sentence? That we just want to give a nomination the full glory of a blurb to itself? Someone please explain, especially as most of you have provided no reasoning so far. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 04:33, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
**I do not see the obvious connection beyond the fact that they're made around the same day, and that some Canadian politician made a offhand reference to the conference. Does anybody have more substantial facts suggesting that the conference had any influence on the Canadian decision? This suggestion troubles me because I believed that the decision in Canada was made (informally) long before the conference happened. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 04:30, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
***The blurb did not say "because of". The fact that an agreement to establish a new treaty replacing Kyoto comes at the same time, even if by coincidence, that one of Kyoto's signatories backs out is a connection on its own. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 04:36, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
**** "The rationale against it is highly enigmatic to me"? It has been argued very clearly and persistently that the two news items are quite ''distinct'', and that ''merging is confusing''. As you well know, Durban is about ''190+ countries'' negotiating to ''join'' a future treaty for ''2015'', this item is about ''Canada'' stepping ''out'' of a ''1997'' treaty which is currently active. Each news item is notable in itself, and sophisticated enough to have a proper blurb explaining it, instead of monster merger likely to confuse. --[[User:Elekhh|Elekhh]] ([[User talk:Elekhh|talk]]) 05:33, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
****:Saying this has been argued very clearly and persistently is quite the exaggeration; most have presented straw-man arguments, repeated the idea that there was no consensus to merge to begin with, or simply expressed disapproval like their positions went without saying.
****:And I really just don't understand how half of the people here see the obvious, direct connection between these two stories, while others say the only connection is that both stories are about climate change. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] article mentions the UN conference when speaking about Canada's withdrawal, while the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] article mentions the Kyoto Protocol. The connection, clearly, is not just climate change; the connection is the two treaties themselves. Canada's impending withdrawal was a point of concern in the conference. Going further, the fact that Canada made do on their promise the day after said conference was over, with the Environmental Minister remarking that the treaty at the conference is a better way forward, is hard to put down as coincidence. This is not just some random guy making an offhand comment about the proposed Durban treaty; this is the ''Environmental Minister'', an ''attendee'' of the conference, making the statement. And, despite what you say, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16151310 every] [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204336104577094950568964294.html?mod=googlenews_wsj reputable] [http://articles.cnn.com/2011-12-13/americas/world_americas_canada-kyoto-protocol-explainer_1_climate-pact-major-emitters-climate-change?_s=PM:AMERICAS news] [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/science/earth/canada-leaving-kyoto-protocol-on-climate-change.html organization] seems perfectly content making a connection between the two stories. How does merging the blurbs confuse readers? If anything, in clarifies things, because, right now, readers are left to wonder what this "new treaty" is replacing. You do realize that's the [[Kyoto Protocol]], right? The same treaty that Canada's withdrawing from?
****:Either way, this is a moot point if the copyright violation concerns remain on the [[Kyoto Protocol]] article. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 06:09, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
*FWIW I was fine with the merge, and if an alternative article could be found, I'd be fine with merged blurb again.  There is an obvious connection here.  ITN has limited space so while media websites may report them as separate events it makes sense for ITN to combine blurbs were possible.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 06:41, 15 December 2011 (UTC)
*:'''Comment''' I don't see why we should promote the "cunning" idea of the Canadian government to link the two acts. No other country has pulled out of the Kyoto protocol, of all that committed to Durban.

I think the argument over whether to say 'disputed' versus 'allegedly flawed' is a. bit of a waste.

I'm new to ITN (in case it wasn't already obvious), and I wasn't aware that Wikipedia's news section doesn't regularly update major news stories outside of particularly major occurrences (which I considered this to be).

Iran has officially complained to the security council. It may have political elements, but it's a big step away from condemning the US on state run TV. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/world/middleeast/iran-complains-to-security-council-about-spy-drone.html] 2. The US has acknowledged that the Iranians "may have" the drone, and that one definitely crashed. [http://www.isaf.nato.int/article/isaf-releases/isaf-releases-statement-on-missing-unmanned-aerial-vehicle-dec-5-2011.html] [http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/drone-belonged-to-cia-officials-say/2011/12/05/gIQAylYGYO_story.html?hpid=z1]. Not the same as shouting out "hey give us back our super secret spy drone" but still significant. 3. The video. --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 02:29, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Weak Support'''. I'm slightly hesitant because of the lack of details and verification, but regardless of that, this controversy has clearly become international in nature.

:::*"Leaders of [[Eurozone]] member states agree to a [[European sovereign debt crisis#European fiscal union|new treaty]] restricting government spending and borrowing"?

(edit conflict)
*'''Provisional Support''' But the blurb needs changing. "Leaders of 26 European Union member states meeting in Brussels agree to a new treaty, which is vetoed by United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron". It is important and changes for ever the relationship between the UK and Europe. It doesn't matter that the ITN at the moment is euro-heavy, there's not been any worthy stories outside of Europe for a while.

::Just on a point of fact, the UK hasn't vetoed the treaty, it has opted not to be part of it. It actually vetoed an alternative proposal to not have a new treaty but instead make amendments to the Lisbon Treaty. That aside, I certainly don't object to improving the blurb. --[[User:FormerIP|FormerIP]] ([[User talk:FormerIP|talk]]) 15:37, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' due to concerns over whether we can be factually accurate and succinct at the same time. It is ''not'' an EU treaty ''because'' the UK has refused to sign it. Equally it's not a Eurozone treaty, or a treaty for states that are or will be in the Eurozone, because Denmark appears to have agreed in principle. I would prefer that we report this when the treaty is ratified, because apart from the UK's position, at the moment a lot of things are as clear as mud, not least whether the countries obliged to have referenda or parliamentary votes will ratify. —[[User talk:WFCforLife|WFC]]—  16:23, 9 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. ITN is Europe-heavy these weeks because the entire world economy hinge on current actions taken by governments in Europe. Refusing to post important events because of their geographical location makes no sense to me. What is this, affirmative action for continents? <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 17:16, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

**:Yea, I'm totally fine with that. That's not "affirmative action" per se; it's just attempting to maintain a constant flow, which is important. But here it seems like we have an attempt to push for candidates from certain geographic regions and neglect others. That just makes no sense to me - if a lot of important things are happening in Europe right now, then of course there would be more European items, and we ought to evaluate them on an equal basis with items from other regions. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 06:50, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
***:Although I stress that I remain opposed due to concerns that haven't been addressed, I do agree that being European should not automatically rule this story out. We're heavy on political items, and we're heavy on European items. That ''is'' a good reason to try harder to find worthy stories outside of that field and region, but ''not'' a good reason to reject a worthy European political story (which at this specific moment in time this agreement-in-principle isn't). —[[User talk:WFCforLife|WFC]]—  08:53, 10 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' until it is a ratified deal; looks like this may not be the done deal the Euro would like everyone to think (see [http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/09/ireland-referendum-idUSL5E7N923220111209 Irish referendum risk hangs over EU deal (Reuters)]).

**To hopefully quash the argument that this is a US-centric story on a sport nobody cares about, consider these:
***In the 24-team [[2010 FIBA World Championship]], the NBA was the league that had the most representatives with 41 players.
***In that championship's all-tournament team, four of five players were on NBA rosters prior to the tourney. Only [[Miloš Teodosić]] was the non-NBAer in the all-tourney team.
***In [[EuroBasket 2011]] (that's like basketball's UEFA Euro 2008), four of the five members of the all-tournament team played in the NBA, with [[Juan Carlos Navarro]] no longer playing in the NBA when the tournament happened, and Macedonia's [[Bo McCalebb]] (naturalized, originally an American) that only player to have never played in the NBA.
***In the [[EuroBasket 2011 Final]], the entirety of France's and Spain's starting lineups were playing in the NBA (the sole exception was Navarro as stated above).
***In the [[2011 FIBA Americas Championship]] (the U.S. did not participate), four of the five members of the all-tournament team were playing in the NBA.
***Furthermore, in these continental championships, the national federations had to put up the burden on providing insurance on the players if they're injured. If the lockout didn't happen, the NBA would've taken most of the costs. This led to some players to skip the championships entirely, the best examples of these were the Australian [[Andrew Bogut]], GBR's [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] and Poland's [[Marcin Gortat]]
***ETA: [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/7527796/Premier-League-footballers-not-the-richest-on-the-planet-revealed.html The Guardian is surprised that the NBA, not the Premier League, has the highest payroll in sport(s)].

*'''Extra comment'''. For people who may not know what this is about...Poets' Corner is a part of Westminster Abbey where many of the greatest figures of British cultural history are either buried or memorialised. Chaucer, Dickens, Kipling, Tennyson, Handel, Samuel Johnson, Macaulay, Browning, Sheridan, Dryden, Laurence Olivier and Edmund Spenser are among the people buried there. Hughes is only the fifth person born since 1900 to have received the honour of a memorial (the others being John Betjeman, Peggy Ashcroft, WH Auden and Dylan Thomas).

*'''Strong Oppose''' per Johnsemlak. This person isn't newsworthy worldwide.

[[User:Beyond495|Beyond495]] ([[User talk:Beyond495|talk]]) 04:19, 7 December 2011 (UTC)
**For the record, Chaucer was buried there in 1400, but his tomb memorial (set against the wall, it's not a statue) was not erected until 1556. Kipling has a gravestone there (not a statue), and a burial service took place there. A distinction is usually drawn between those buried there and those memorialised there later. Most of the memorials take the form of wall-mounted memorials or busts or memorial stones set into the floor (as opposed to gravestones). Some of the larger (tomb-type) memorials have statues incorporated into them, but most don't. Part of the honour here is being accorded a space on the floor, rather than in the memorial window. The most recent additions before this one were the Royal Ballet stone in 2009 (a group commemoration) and a panel for Elizabeth Gaskell added in 2010 to the memorial window. This memorial window (which was erected because the floor space was running out) has space for 20 names and 7 used so far, so deciding to put Hughes on the floor has some significance, though that may be partly because they wanted to put him next to T. S. Eliot. It is about the 7th memorial added here since Maitland in 2001 (four floor stones, three window panels). It doesn't happen often, and is a great honour [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 17:18, 7 December 2011 (UTC)

Ok, I had thought that the Russian elections were done and posted, but I'd say we should now update the blurb to mention the protests afterwards.  8000 anti-Putin protesters reportedly gathered in Moscow.  A larger pro-Putin party also gathered in opposition.  A huge police force was deployed in response.

*'''Support'''. I supported the Gary Speed nomination, and on the same principle support this as long as the update is sufficient. On a general note, there is far too much comparing between similar nominations. ITN doesn't ''have'' to be consistent, and people trying to attain consistency will end up driving things to the lowest common denominator as oppose votes come in purely because people are trying to restore some unattainable goal of consistency.

****Not really. There is a problem with sources. Most of the accusations of violations are connected not to the election itself, which seems to be found OK both by domestic and foreign monitors, but to the pre-election period of electoral agitation. The lion's share of the reported violations was published by the so called [[GOLOS Association]], funded from abroad, openly biased against the government and leading party (as the videos with their director show), and itself fined by the court for the violations of electoral law (they published information on any reported violations, even fake ones, directed against all parties except the UR, and they suppressed a large share of anti-UR violations; also they were issuing fake journalist accreditations for their workers). Therefore, when the information comes originally from marginal, controversial and biased sources, its redistribution in encyclopedia is dubious. [[User:Greyhood|<font color="darkgrey">Grey</font><font color="grey">Hood</font>]] [[User talk:Greyhood|<font color="black"><sup>Talk</sup></font>]] 21:02, 4 December 2011 (UTC)
*****I think a great majority of the news outlets in the West mention the election being unfair (most serious allegation being the insufficient press coverage of the opposition parties), so as long as the allegations can be sourced to e.g. BBC and ''The New York Times'' it is definitely not "redistribution of marginal, controversial and biased sources." A working, free press is generally seen as a prerequisite for a democratic election in every Anglophone country, including the UK and the US. So although an election might have taken place without vote rigging as claimed by the Communists, it can still be seen as undemocratic by the foreign press. --[[User:Hydrox|hydrox]] ([[User talk:Hydrox|talk]]) 01:18, 5 December 2011 (UTC)

******You're confused. The article mentions electoral irregularities and the usual fraud, which is commonplace in any political system (transparent or otherwise) outside the few developed, prosperous countries in the First World. It did ''not'' accuse UR of systematically oppressing political opponents to gain an unfair advantage, which is what some users here seem to suggest/believe. In fact the article states this: "According to United Russia observers, the Communist Party, which is considered their main rival in the elections, accounts for the largest number of violations." Just because there is fraud does not mean it's worth mentioning; it's only worthwhile if the fraud has a chance of significantly affecting the election results, and there doesn't seem to be that possibility here (see the last 5 paragraphs of the article you linked to).<b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 04:32, 5 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Support'''; the article will be expanded ''once election results are in''. Obviously there is no prose to be written when the election results aren't out. And I do not agree with adding further "allegations of violence and fraud". It should be clear to anyone with a basic knowledge in Russian politics that there will be allegations of fraud (mostly from Western-funded groups) regardless of what actually happened. While there likely ''is'' some form of fraud, as in every election in the world, we should not be giving credibility to specific politically-motivated accusations, or "propaganda" as Greyhood puts it. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 20:40, 4 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' It may be breaking news but I don't think it is news of sufficient significance to post on ITN. The primary elections haven't started; his poll numbers had been tanking for weeks; his withdrawal will have little effect on the presidential race let alone current events more broadly. --[[User:Mkativerata|Mkativerata]] ([[User talk:Mkativerata|talk]]) 20:40, 3 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' We need to know the eventual winner of the election next November: anything else is gloss.  [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 20:50, 3 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Support''' The fact that he made it this far given his background was fairly remarkable in itself. [[User:Beyond495|Beyond495]] ([[User talk:Beyond495|talk]]) 21:00, 3 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. Cain was never the favourite for the Republican primaries (his numbers never went above 10% on [[Intrade]], though he led national polls for a week or two). By last week, after numerous sex scandals, he was polling at 8% nationally and his chances on Intrade was around 0.8%, lower than candidates like Bachmann or Huntsman, which is a good sign of how non-notable his campaign has become. Given that, this announcement is hardly unexpected and mostly irrelevant to the election results. (I also have issue with the blurb. While several of the accusations are about sexual misconduct, the latest and most damaging accusation seems to be a 13-year extramarital affair, which is not a form of "misconduct".) <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 21:05, 3 December 2011 (UTC)
**Cain was actually the favorite in a lot of states, and he polled high on Rasmussen during the height of his campaign. I would hardly call him "non-notable" - at least, prior to the scandals.--[[User:WaltCip|WaltCip]] ([[User talk:WaltCip|talk]]) 23:25, 3 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' this is a local issue with limited global interest (really, who outside a subset of Americans cares?). Agree with Jim Sukwutput, Cain was a long shot to begin with. This primary is shaping up to be interesting though, like a candidate roulette wheel, and the [[Republican_Party_(United_States)_presidential_primaries|article]] might make a good FA candidate some day. --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 21:56, 3 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''.  Zero interest outside US.  [[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 21:58, 3 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Of no notability and interest whatsoever, at all.{{unsigned|Doktorbuk}}
*'''Oppose''' - As Mtking says, not significant outside the Republican Party. This would have easily been significant if Cain was still a frontrunner (or near frontrunner) in the race (anyone who thinks US presidential elections are not internationally significant, even at the primary level, is ''kidding'' themselves). However, all of the accusations have already completely destroyed his campaign's chances, and him dropping out of the race at this point has little to no actual effects. Thus, while this ''is'' big news in the US, it doesn't satisfy our significance criterion.

:::Please don't pass judgement on matters (significance without the US) that you do not have the perspective to judge.  I would venture to say that there are very almost no issues on which the media coverage is more out of proportion to public interest, in the UK at least.  In terms of practical significance, nothing other than the November result matters in the least; in terms of public attention, it really is way, way below the horizon in what you might be inclined to call "watercooler talk".

::::Do you have a source on your measurement of 'watercooler talk'?  I work in a British workplace and while it isn't of everyday interest, US politics certainly is on the radar.

*'''Oppose'''. While the article should cover the allegations, I think putting them on the main page would be an endorsement of their credibility.

*'''Neutral''' I can respect both sides here. It is an historical event and one which will have lasting effects in US and Burmese history.

****I'm utterly sincere in my objection. An American diplomat and politician visited a country, it's not a big deal. Myanmar has relations with Russia, the ASEAN, the UN, I don't think it's spectacular that the American government has sent someone for a photo-op.

*****Okay, at least you put up some debatable reasons. But this is not a photo op. A photo op is set up by a single party; this visit was agreed upon by three parties (the American state, the Burmese state, and the Burmese opposition) that generally do not see eye to eye.

******The government released San Suu Kyi from house arrest and it was covered on ITN, then San Suu Kyi announced she would register for the next election, and it was covered on ITN. Russia, China, Japan (off and on) and others had been dealing with Myanmar for years. I'm generally not in favor of posting every incremental update to XYZ saga, especially one like this with no measurable results. Elections: yes, restoration of civilian government: sure, this: no. If the story was "United States abandons failed policies of isolation and engages in talks with Myanmar" then maybe, since that seems to be the real story here: America gave up the hate. --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 12:19, 3 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Reluctantly support the story, oppose the blurb'''. I do not think this would ordinarily be a worthy candidate for ITN, but we haven't updated in ages, the articles are in good shape and there aren't many other viable candidates on this page.

*'''Oppose'''.  When real democratic changes actually take place there, it will certainly be newsworthy.  Until then, a visit from a quite senior politician from a quite important country isn't sufficiently notable.  Interesting that no-one has proposed the visit of the Belarus PM to Burma, which local sources judged to be a more important event - [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/01/hillary-clinton-burma-belarus-leader].

*'''Oppose''' The legalisation and re-registration of the National League for Democracy has already been noted at ITN.  Thus we have established on this page that a "normalcy" of sorts in the political system exists in Myanmar/Burma.  So we have a politician with responsibility for foreign issues visiting a foreign country, albeit one where she would probably prefer to see a different party in government.  It is normal in most democracies (even very flawed democracies) for opposition parties to have access to visiting foreign dignitaries.
