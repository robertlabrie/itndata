*'''Oppose'''.  He has NOT retired from cricket, he has retired from Test cricket--he'll still likely play in the lucrative 20/20 cricket.

*'''Oppose'''. Even if this was a retirement from all forms of cricket, I would still oppose due to fear of setting a precedent we later regret.<p>I can't see this being posted, but I'll explain my reasoning for the benefit of those who aren't sure whether or not to nominate other retirements in future. Don Bradman would be setting the bar too high, but the problem with going much lower is that there are too many other sportsmen of a similar age who could make a similarly strong case for posting. Sticking to cricket, Ponting was an extremely successful captain despite his Ashes record, but should we also have posted all of Graeme Smith, Steve Waugh, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss? Batting wise he's in the class of Lara, Tendulkar, Dravid and Kallis, but should we post all of their retirements? Most of the second list were captains, and most of the first list were fantastic batsmen. And that's not even considering people from other sports with a comparable or level of interest from the English-speaking world.<p>I would definitely support Alex Ferguson &ndash; almost certainly the best manager or head coach in ''any'' sport in the last generation and a half, and to my knowledge he has never appeared on the Main Page. The only other person I would probably support would be Roger Federer, due to the general consensus on his status within tennis &ndash; but even then I'd have a second thought due to his prior prominence on ITN. I might have considered Michael Schumacher in 2006, Tiger Woods had he called it a day a few years ago, and there may be comparable figures to the above in sports that I'm less interested in. For what it's worth I would vote against Tendulkar, on the basis that we posted the two things that set him apart from Ponting.<p>Sorry for the long-winded post, but I hope that helps others understand where I come from on sporting retirements. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]— <sub>'''[[User:WaitingForConnection/FL wishlist|FL wishlist]]'''</sub> 08:25, 1 December 2012 (UTC)

*::Quite true actually. Cricket is only popular on most the teams that made it to the Cricket World Cup Super 8 -- 12 countries in all, if you consider the West Indies as one "country", and I dunno if it's that popular in the likes of Kenya and Ireland. The rest of the world: zip, probably except for UAE.

*::::I'm just privy to the word "world-wide" and "global" as that means at least someone anywhere must've seen the sport being played, or even better, played the sport. I'm ok with "international" to describe cricket but "global" and "world-wide" is pushing it. India isn't exactly the world, and outside of South Asia, the West Indies, England and [[South Africa|SA]][[New Zealand|NZ]][[Australia|A]] it has close to zero coverage. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 14:53, 3 December 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''': The retirements of highest level icon players are benchmark setting moments in any sport. Ponting, together with Tendulkar and Lara are described as the holy trinity of batting for this concluding generation. He is one of only three players in history to have scored 13,000 Test runs <small>(we didnt post Dravid though)</small>. Statistically, he is the most successful captain of all time. Ponting is also the without much debate, second best Australian batsman since the Don. He holds the records for most test runs by any Australian batsman ever, so with his retirement a benchmark has been set to those two records. He also retired such that he only equaled and not surprised Steve Waugh's record for most Test caps, and he also chose to retire with the 2013 Ashes in sight. All of these add up to what can be reasonably described as an important development in the sport.

The Leveson Inquiry was the inevitable consequence of the scandal, but ''in the context of what we already knew and have already posted'', I don't think there is enough in the report to warrant posting. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]— <sub>'''[[User:WaitingForConnection/FL wishlist|FL wishlist]]'''</sub> 23:15, 29 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' inadequate update. For a blurb item the old DC applies.

** I'm sorry an actor, a boxer, and a baseball executive didn't impact the world and tens of thousands of people lives unlike Murray, and except for Camacho, neither death was notable as well (I think Hagman and Camacho would have gotten full blurb main page postings in all honestly, Hagman because he was one of the most popular television actors of all-time and still acting at the time of his death, and Camacho because of his death, Miller despite his impact to American sports probably wouldn't have been in the main page). The only reason why I'm not updating Murray article myself is that I'm not a medical specialist, but the person who had made the biggest impact to making organ transplants a common place today is totally worthy of a full blurb. [[User:Secret|Secret]] <sup>[[User talk:Secret|account]]</sup> 07:17, 28 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Policy?''' Camacho and Hagman are still drawing quite a readership and are only 3 and 4 days old.  Miller was added very quickly and probably won't get anywhere near the reader interest, which was one of the reasons for having a ticker; ''reader interest''.  I don't think this nom will have as much interest as any of the three currently listed articles, and I don't see it as blurbworthy.  But I am otherwise unopposed--if we can have all four up at once. Another solution would be moving the '''Recent deaths''' link itself to right after '''More current events''' on the same line as current events and the Syria ticker, allowing more room on the line below it to fit four or five names if more than three per line is problematic.  That would be my preference in general regardless of the plethora of recent noms. [[User:Medeis|μηδείς]] ([[User talk:Medeis|talk]]) 04:13, 28 November 2012 (UTC)

:::::::I think it's you who can't possibly be serious, Tariq.  The line "Joseph Murray - Marvin Miller – Héctor Camacho – Larry Hagman" would be of the same length as "Recent Deaths:  Marvin Miller – Héctor Camacho – Larry Hagman" which we already had.  If that line wasn't already too long the new format wouldn't be either.  And as for screen resolution, that's a personal choice you made when you purchased your device.

::::::::Now you're just being arrogant. A significant number of people, for a number of reasons, don't have ultra-high screen resolutions, and we shouldn't be backing them in a corner in order to unnecessarily (and sloppily) squeeze more content into the template. Maybe it's actually three, as the line with "Syrian civil war...Recent deaths:" is longer, but the point is, there is little informational benefit, and potentially significant aesthetic detriment. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 18:53, 28 November 2012 (UTC)
::::::::Arrogant?  You start out with saying "you can't be serious" and accuse me of arrogance?

*'''Support for recent deaths''': Murray's ''work'' has had a major impact, his ''death'' itself hasn't. He stopped operating 25 years ago. He died of old age, and a death at age 93 cannot be completely unexpected. The article does not hold much information related to the death, except the fact that it occured. The article has been expanded significantly, so this can be posted soon. --[[User:RJFF|RJFF]] ([[User talk:RJFF|talk]]) 13:58, 28 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support for recent deaths''' or for ITN, with article improvement. @RJFF - we hive criteria for recent deaths, and the death itself having an impact is not required.

::I don't think it's necessary.

*'''Unnotable''' Hagman, taken off the ticker, has had over 30,000 views today.  Joseph Murray has had 5,000 & I haven't seen him mentioned in the press anywhere.  Hagman should be back on the ticker, but, regardless, Murray simply doesn't qualify as notable enough for a full blurb nomination. [[User:Medeis|μηδείς]] ([[User talk:Medeis|talk]]) 04:35, 29 November 2012 (UTC)

*:No, you can't, because this appears to be the first Grey Cup posted in a number of years despite it being the top level contest in its sport just as the Super Bowl, the McCarthy Cup or the Tour de France/Giro d'Italia are, and we've posted all those this year without much fuss (well, the McCarthy Cup took some arguing).

*::How about you and Scorpion look at the archives before spouting such nonsense? "Biased admin"? Considering I was one of the people who responded to the [[99th Grey Cup]], I take umbrage to this baseless accusation. Whenever I respond to an ITN/C nomination, I insist on a relevant update. For sporting events, that means some prose about the event itself. A year later, the [[99th Grey Cup]] article still has ''no prose whatsoever'' under "Game summary". And, guess what? The [[100th Grey Cup]] article isn't any better; I still have ''no idea'' what happened during the game, because the article doesn't say. The standards haven't changed, and they are widely published. Rather than making idiotic conspiracy claims, how about you actually fulfill the criteria for posting.

*::::::You're going with the "two wrongs make a right" argument?  Jayron32 posted ''both'' items prematurely.

*:::::::No, I'm going with the "don't act like a condescending dick about a valid point" argument; regardless of motive the nominator was rightly entitled to point out the discrepancy between when a significant update is expected and when it's waived. [[User:Grapple X|<span style="color:#556655"><small>'''GRAPPLE'''</small></span>]] [[User talk:Grapple X|<span style="color:#556655"><small>'''X'''</small></span>]] 19:34, 26 November 2012 (UTC)
*::::::::Firstly, the nominator drew no such comparison.  He/she attributed past omissions to the sentiment that "Oh, it's only the CFL", combined with "some biased admin [coming] along and [finding] some silly reason not to post it" (an outright lie, ''self-described'' as a "cheap tactic" employed for the purpose of "manipulation").  No mention of article updates (let alone a double standard regarding when they're required) was made.<br />Secondly, you didn't merely condemn the inconsistency; you opined that ''this'' item should have simply been posted.  How is that not a "two wrongs make a right" argument?<br />Thirdly, on what do you base the assertion that such a "discrepancy" (related to subject matter) exists?  Again, the administrator who posted the U.S. election item prematurely also posted the Grey Cup item prematurely.  The problem is that certain admins sometimes neglect to uphold the update requirement, ''not'' that certain topics are systematically favored in such a manner.  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 21:23, 26 November 2012 (UTC)
*:::::::::I did not insist this should have automatically been posted, but that it should not be overlooked; there's a difference. Frankly I feel that sporting events and elections could be considered "updated" with a result rather than needing a meaty text update, but that has no bearing here as I didn't bring it up earlier. I simply responded to the tone of Jayron's response (strange ''that'' isn't the "two wrongs" you're picking up on as it actually is something the phrase describes) by explaining that the nominator would be expected to be tetchy given the sporting events that could be seen as being on par with this one that went up with no fuss, ''not'' demanding this be posted promptly. The fact that the same editor posted both of the stories with no updates should speak further to the baselessness of their condescending remarks, as they're the editor responsible for introducing the slippery precedent of "X was posted with no update, why wasn't Y?". As for the comparisons being drawn, the nominator lamented past Grey Cups not being posted; they weren't posted because of their lack of updates; there is now a case of recent stories being posted with no updates which seems to create a disparity between what goes up with what content. This is a pretty simple train of thought to follow without needing to spelt out. I guess I'll think twice before taking someone to task for their holier-than-thou tone in future lest I find my mouth full of someone else's words again.

*::::::::::I'm ''not'' defending Jayron32's premature postings.  (I await his explanation below.)  I'm noting that this problem (about which ''I've'' complained on multiple occasions) has far more to do with certain administrators than it does with certain subjects.  Past years' Grey Cup events weren't discriminated against because they pertained to Canadian football.  The items were omitted because the nominations happened to be evaluated by admins who applied our inclusion criteria properly.  Other items, whose nominations happened to be evaluated by admins who ''didn't'' apply our inclusion criteria properly, have slipped through inappropriately.  I don't condone that in the slightest, but it has nothing to do with "biased admins" "find[ing] some silly reason" (as the nominator falsely claimed, without even ''mentioning'' the lack of an article update).  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 22:30, 26 November 2012 (UTC)
*:::::::::It was not an "outright lie", because it DID happen last year. And I've seen plenty of cases of admins picking and choosing what they post, and I've seen several cases of one admin over-ruling the consensus of several people. It was pointing this out in the nomination that was the tactic. Either way, I'm not sure what the point of continuing this discussion is, because I can't see anything good coming of it. -- [[User:Scorpion0422|<font color="#FF8C00">Scorpion</font>]]<sup>[[user talk:Scorpion0422|<font color="black">0422</font>]]</sup> 21:40, 26 November 2012 (UTC)
*::::::::::The article update requirement is plainly and unambiguously stated in the ITN inclusion criteria, and it was plainly and unambiguously cited when the item was omitted.

*::::OK.  If you're prepared for the full explanation, here it is: My goal was to see the article improved, and I thought that exposure on the main page would spur that on.  The article had a bare minimum update (a few sentences in the lead and in the infobox), and the quality of the rest of the article was pretty darn good; better than a lot of the sports articles we get through here.  When I posted it, I thought to myself "Well, it isn't perfect, but it is ITNR, so it would go up if there was a few more sentences of an update.  [[WP:IAR|What the heck]], lets just post it and see if being on the main page attracts enough attention to get it expanded, since this is a really good start as an article".  Or, as I explained originally, because I am a bad person.  Whichever reason people wish to believe about me, I am comfortable with.  I stand by the posting, both when I did it, and especially with the state it is in now.  If anyone wishes to demand that my admin bit is removed for this, they are free to make that request from ArbCom.  --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 04:03, 27 November 2012 (UTC)

Not a typical regional election; deals with the question of Catalonian independence and the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]] affecting Spain, so there's been a large amount of international coverage.

*'''Oppose''' Bit of political opportunism, to try to get a majority for the nationalist party so that they can get a referendum up while the political iron is hot.  If they achieve that, then the referendum will be ITNworthy, but the local election to try to create the circumstances for that to happen is too far removed to be on the front page. [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 10:23, 25 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' - An organized major attempt to enable the breakup of Spain, done after masive demonstrations and despite heavy odds of getting this far. Set amid ongoing turmoil in Spain where unemployment is at about 25%, this is a fascinating subject and eminently ITN-worthy. Catalans would face extreme difficulties in setting up a new nation, including EU membership, but have their own language, flag and fiercely independent traditions. Article a bit on the thin side for content but is acceptable. Strongly suggest anyone on the fence regarding their !vote do some deeper looking into the subject; this is a very big deal.

[[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]<sup> [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]</sup> 11:36, 25 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' Catalonia is an historically independent nation with a separate standardized language and a population significantly greater than Scotland, Denmark, or the Whole of Ireland.  To describe its elections as "local" is a farce.  Neither is this some stunt like the London or Wisconsin political protests we post on ITN, it's an official state action.  Calling upon us to wait until we have results makes sense--that's not actually an oppose vote.  Calling on us to wait until they have independence makes about as much sense as no political news out of Scotland, Wales, or Norther Ireland til they throw off the monarchical yoke. [[User:Medeis|μηδείς]] ([[User talk:Medeis|talk]]) 18:16, 25 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''.  This election, as I understand it, is to elect their local Parliament, not to decide Independence.  Once the Parliament has been formed, then the majority parties can decide to hold an independence vote (leaving aside legal problems with doing so).  The actual Independence vote(or even the formal decision to hold one) would be ITN worthy, but this election is not. [[User:331dot|331dot]] ([[User talk:331dot|talk]]) 22:04, 25 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Strongest possible oppose''' Elections are supposed to be posted for all states on the [[List of sovereign states]]. If we can frown on San Marino because it's "too small" we can definitely frown upon this sub-national non-state which is crying foul now that it might have to pay it's share of the bill for decades of riding along with Spain. When they get independence and make the list, then fine, until then I don't care how many people are there or how different the language is, it's not a state and it's elections do not go to the front page. --[[User:IP98|IP98]] ([[User talk:IP98|talk]]) 01:06, 26 November 2012 (UTC)
::I suppose "pay their fair share" is a joke on your part? "With more people than Denmark and an economy almost as big as Portugal's, Catalonia has its own language. Like Basques, Catalans see themselves as distinct from the rest of Spain. ... Many Catalans are angry that Rajoy has refused to negotiate a new tax deal with their largely self-governing region. Annually, an estimated 16 billion euros ($21 billion) in taxes paid in Catalonia, about 8 percent of its economic output, is not returned to the region."

*'''Oppose''' on the grounds that they are not a sovereign state, nor is this a sovereignty referendum. We did not post the results of the [[2012 Quebec election]] where the sovereigntists returned to power, so it would be a double standard to post the results of a similiar-sized region of Spain. --[[User:Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF0000">Plasma</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF4500">Twa</font>]][[User talk:Plasma Twa 2|<font color="#FF0000">2</font>]] 08:45, 26 November 2012 (UTC)

That fact that there were few fatalities was a triumph of engineering, given the speeds and number of vehicles. This is far from a "meh" item.

*'''Weak support''' - This story's notability derives not just from the cultural and political standing of the BBC, but also the recent furore about alleged child abuse by one or more of the Corporation's most prominent celebrities in the 1970s and 80s, and the subsequent fumbled reporting of these claims. This is therefore part of a much larger story - but one that is still relatively localised - hence my only moderate support of the posting. [[User:AlexTiefling|AlexTiefling]] ([[User talk:AlexTiefling|talk]]) 14:08, 22 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''': Identity of the DG makes little or no direct difference to viewers/listeners.  Resignation was related to an implicit accusation in cases totally unrelated to Savile. Insufficient depth of impact to counter limited geographical relevance. [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 19:31, 22 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - I have disambiguated the link to Tony Hall and provided a shorter blurb.  (No blurb was provided but there was altblurb!)  [[User:Yaris678|Yaris678]] ([[User talk:Yaris678|talk]]) 11:07, 23 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' - 1. He will be head of a large corporation that transmits in many countries all over the world.  2. The decision on who would be the next DG has been a major topic of discussion in the UK.  I would also like to say I prefer the shorter blurb I have just added.  The longer blurb is problematic for reasons highlighted by Kevin McE.  [[User:Yaris678|Yaris678]] ([[User talk:Yaris678|talk]]) 11:07, 23 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - if this does go forward with the alt blurb, the link should be to the [[North Wales child abuse scandal]] - which is what contributed indirectly to the last DG's resignation - and not the (largely distinct) Savile scandal.  [[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 16:35, 23 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Opppose'''. Two wrongs don't make a right. In the [[Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates/November 2012#George Entwistle resignation|previous discussion]], our [[Wikipedia:Administrators|judges]] gave weight to three votes which ''appeared'' insular in nature, one which correctly recited ITN policy without giving any insight into why the nomination failed that test, and an oppose based on a comment which was actioned in the form of a significantly revised blurb. That monumental cock-up does not justify posting a far less notable chapter in the story. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]— <sub>'''[[User:WaitingForConnection/FL wishlist|FL wishlist]]'''</sub> 02:53, 24 November 2012 (UTC)

It has brought the Republic of Ireland's controversial abortion laws to the fore of the political sphere once again after many decades and caused a divide between India and Ireland. Note that, though she died in Ireland in October, her death only broke the other day (the article was first created on 17 November), has led to protests nationwide and internationally, and is constantly "in the news" across the world (including the headlines in several countries) what with [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20401081 today's inquiry announcement], demonstrations all weekend, etc. As well as this the article is well-sourced and goes into extensive detail on the case.
}}
*'''Oppose''' until more facts are available and the article is updated.  As it is, the only first-hand source is Savita Halappanavar's husband, and beyond that the article has very little information about her death and focuses entirely on political reactions.  A reader could not read that article and come to any conclusion other than; these politicians say this and those politicians say that.  The timing of the onset of sepsis, the dual role of Irish and Common law and a complete account of the diagnoses are missing from the article, and I think these are necessary before the article can be considered encyclopedic.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/130.188.8.27|130.188.8.27]] ([[User talk:130.188.8.27|talk]]) 15:54, 20 November 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*::Funny, I'm pretty sure I didn't mention anything about equalising anything. I'm not going to get into who's "right" in this but I've always sided with Palestine.

*:::You said you liked the blurb, so it is just as easy to respond to you as to Kevin, and by putting it below both your comment and his, I was hoping you'd both respond. I don't really care "who you side with", or if you side with anyone at all. The point is, vaguely saying "resulting in dozens of civilian deaths", when one side's civilian deaths -- even by Israeli estimates -- are outnumbered 10:1, is highly misleading and just as much, if not more, a faux pas as stating Israel's reported reasons for beginning this incursion. Considering the linked article is to the Israeli operation, rather than something like [[Second Gaza War]] (which would probably focus on both sides actions equally), it seems very much appropriate to focus on the Israeli action. Not to mention that Hamas firing rockets on southern Israel isn't exactly news; Israel's operation is. So, something like the following, borrowing elements from the two blurbs proposed already, seems better:
*:::<blockquote>[[Israel]] launches a '''[[Operation Pillar of Defense|major military operation]]''' in the [[Gaza Strip]], as hostilities with [[Hamas]] escalate.</blockquote>
*:::I guarantee you Kevin's blurb will be met with resistance at [[WP:ERRORS]] or elsewhere, for the precise reason I mentioned. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 21:44, 19 November 2012 (UTC)
::::It is precisely because Palestinian civilian casualties are greater that I counter-proposed against the "They asked for it" tone of the original: I didn't "equalise", I chose not to specify.  Any blurb is going to be something of a tightrope (there is already an objection to removing the reference to retaliation below), there is no point in narrowing it further. Let the blurb be neutral, or safe and broad, to the point of being anodyne to direct people to the article (which is after all the stated purpose of ITN), and let the reader see what might eventually resemble a balanced article that might help them come to their own conclusions about where justice lies. I would rather, however, see an article based on the conflict as a whole, not the Israeli action. [[User:Kevin McE|Kevin McE]] ([[User talk:Kevin McE|talk]]) 22:22, 19 November 2012 (UTC)

::::::Then a blurb which presents the raw numbers would be best; my main objection to the proposed blurb was the recursive "this was a response to this" opening which seemed to justify the deaths caused. A modification of Kevin's proposal with raw numbers ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20391558 BBC] seem to be reporting 105 deaths caused by Israel, or at least not refuting the figure) would be a good idea.

**Its probably best left as a judgement call for the admin, but I would say to put this at top, or wherever it fits chronologically, and take away Jabari blurb because they're both part of the same running story.
**Not posting Kevin's hook because it doesn't have links is unnecessary. Blurbs do not need to be posted verbatim from nominations anyway, so adding links while posting is more than fine.
**<s>The problem I have with Tariq's blurb is that it implies that Hamas fired their rockets, finished up, then Israel retaliated with Amud Anan. During the operation, Hamas is still firing rockets and Israel is firing back. It's not like they're taking turns, and Israel is currently taking a turn at launching.</s>

:'''full blurb''' I was just coming here to say that it should be a full blurb as nothing ever in deaths so far (since WP ITN) has been bigger (though i did consider Kichner's recent edeath as an example but wasnt sure how big the funeral was): This is perhaps the largest funeral in the world since Nasser (or even Milosevic) but its more as the top 5/10 biggest cities in the world was brought to \a complete standstill (and voluntarily). Pharmacies were closed and every single outlet except 5-star hotels (not even hole-in-the-wall cigarette stands, no water sales from even street stalls), although ive now found out the club/s ppened after 6pm (and had liquor) (should be closing in 20 mins, as normal ;)). Nevertheless, the magnitude of 2 million+ people at a funeral is unprecedented, and, unlike the above examples, India was a democracy, which is notable for the mass following he did get and transparently built a statue as such (without the state apparatus). Even opposition figures and minorities for a "hindu nationalist" were present. as i write [[Times Now]] is showing him saying "there are only 2 castes in the world rich and poor. make poor rich but dont make rich poor". As theyre saying, mass following unprecedented (in a democracy of this size) and even women (and minorities). A funeral with so much support...anyone would want it, but i doubt yull have this in over a generation.[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 17:49, 18 November 2012 (UTC)

I have yet to see a convincing reason as to why this shouldn't be posted, other than those who are not from the US saying they aren't notable. It's perfectly acceptable to not be knowledgeable of every product outside of one's home country, but you need to look at it from the other country's point of view, hence the reason for "Do not complain about an event only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. This applies to a high percentage of the content we post and is unproductive." in the very large and un-noticed blue box at the top of this page. Just because it doesn't matter in the UK, doesn't mean it's not important (same goes for non-US stories!).

I support the postings of things like Cricket and non-US elections, which mean absolutely zilch to me in the US, because I understand the significance to other countries. Hostess IS a highly notable brand in the US, and a pioneer in the mass-production of baked goods, and not just for Twinkies, either.

*'''Conditional Support''': No question in my mind regarding notability, only regarding article quality (hardly any text update). Reg. notability: '''(1)ITN/R''': If it is on ITN/R, it means notability has already been deemed as satisfied and requires only update quality to be verified. ITN/R clearly states that results of general elections of all countries listed in the [[List of Sovereign states]] are considered notable for posting on ITN. '''(2)No exceptions''': ITN/R provides for case-to-case discussion on merits for certain topics like changes to heads of government. However, there are no exceptions or exclusions to the above rule on general elections provided under ITN/R. If the consensus is that certain countries need to be excluded, then the ITN/R rule needs to be changed. This has been suggested and debated several times (motions that I recall from memory included that micronations be excluded, only G20 be included, large sub-national entities /city elections be included, have an elections ticker, etc) but no change has been brought about. The basis of categorization has always been sovereignty. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 04:24, 16 November 2012 (UTC)

Calling it an assassination is not POV, as assassination is the correct description. Striking officers and leader in armed conflict is still assassination.

::While I may regard this as an assassination, I note that the BBC's front-page reporting uses 'killed' to refer to victims of recent attacks on both sides. It only switches to 'assassinated' for its sidebar in the main report, linking Jabari's killing to those of other Palestinian leaders in the past. There is absolutely nothing untrue about ''killed'', and it's an unjust accusation to call it dishonest or a disservice. He evidently has been killed, and it was a consequence of a targeted military campaign. I don't think any reasonable person reading our headline would conclude that Jabari's death was an unintended side-effect - collateral damage, if you will - rather than a deliberate part of this operation. Please keep your POV-pushing out of this, even when it's my POV too. [[User:AlexTiefling|AlexTiefling]] ([[User talk:AlexTiefling|talk]]) 11:00, 15 November 2012 (UTC)
:::You're wrong on every level. 3 separate BBC news programmes, News Channel, Newsnight and Radio 5 Live have repeatedly called this assassination. 8000+ news sources are calling it assassination. If you disagree say so, but don't dare accuse me of POV pushing. If ITN is to be consistent and trsuted in its news delivery it should reflect what reliable sources are reporting, not dumbing it down. It could easily be read as being killed in a military operation, because that's what it says. The fact is our headline is missing a key word, "targeted".

:::::Of course it's true but it is not the whole truth is it? A military figurehead killed in a military operation would not be a headline, unless they were a 4 or 5 star U.S. General. The whole point of this being notable is that the 2nd in command in Hamas was intentionally targeted (assassinated). He didn't just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up getting killed. We could dumb down any newsworthy story to a vapid, wishy-washy headline that causes no offence, but since every reputable news outlet is describing this accurately why should WP ITN stand out as lacking in precision?

:::Putting aside the fact that the BBC is to PBS what Barack Obama is to [[United States presidential election, 1972|George McGovern]], the comparison is irrelevant, as ''neither'' departure would be posted in ordinary circumstances.<p>Jerry Sandusky was based at Penn State until 2011 via [[The Second Mile]]; while well respected for what he achieved as a coach, he was not by any stretch of the imagination pivotal to Penn State's existence or prosperity, in the way that [[Sir Alex Ferguson]] might be considered at [[Manchester United]]. Yet we posted Sandusky because of how big the story was, and probably wouldn't post Ferguson because his departure will ultimately be that of an elderly man deciding to retire.

*'''Support'''. This isn't about "my organisation beats your organisation", nor about "my country beats your country" (and if there ''is'' a racial element to voting, that should be removed not only from here, but from Wikipedia completely). Which organisations they come from is irrelevant &ndash; if we were to choose 50 universities which are allowed one story per year (that itself would be overkill), I'm not convinced that Penn State would make the list. Petraeus stepped down due to an extramarital affair: sadly that's quite common nowadays. Entwistle stepped down because the actions of his flagship news show led to the British equivalent of a Senator being wrongly accused of being a paedophile &ndash; thankfully that is not common. The trail that BBC Newsnight started led to the British equivalent of the US President being given (on another station) a list of people he knew, whilst doing an interview live on air, and asked whether he was going to personally check whether they had abused children. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]— <sub>'''[[User:WaitingForConnection/FL wishlist|FL wishlist]]'''</sub> 07:15, 11 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. From what I remember (though I may be wrong) ITN hasn't featured anything about the abuse scandals that are currently the top story in the UK, and in fact have been for many weeks - which I think is a problem. This would be an easy way to include it, just add something like ''Amid the ongoing [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|child abuse scandal]] in the United Kingdom, ...''. And I would also think that some of the comparisons drawn here don't work; Petraeus' resignation wasn't notable (from what I know) because it had nothing to do with his job; if he had resigned after being accused of leaking information or something similar then that would be more important. I would think exactly the same if it were the head of MI5 or any security service. Where as in this case the resignation is directly because of actions taken as head of the organisation. Secondly I think comparing (the head of) PBS to (the head of) the BBC is a little off, though admittedly as a non-American, I still believe no one can think that the two organisations are that comparable both within their own country and certainly internationally.--[[User:Martin23230|'''<font face="Century Gothic" size="3">23230'''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Martin23230|<font face="Century Gothic">talk</font>]]</sup> 07:48, 11 November 2012 (UTC)
::'''Comment''':  If this is to be included, a better link would be to the [[North Wales child abuse scandal]], which is what led to the resignation.

[[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 11:40, 13 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I think we need to be careful about conflating the resignation (essentially due to a lack of confidence in his managerial competence in handling the reporting of the abuse claims) and the wider issues of the child abuse claims themselves. They are not the same and there are at least 3 or 4 related articles in mainspace.

*'''Oppose''', [[User:Leaky caldron]] makes a very valid point that the required brevity of the ITN sentences means that the implication to a non-UK reader is that Entwistle is somehow implicated in the abuse itself, rather than being manager of the organisation whose coverage of the matter has been brought into question.

For a second I thought this might have been one of those long-tenured positions which would carry a bit of gravitas (think [[Robert Mueller]]'s eleven-plus-year reign as FBI director) but Petraeus has held the job for a year, which really doesn't strike me as showing that the position changing hands is that notable, as it seems to have occurred half a dozen times in the past few years.

:*'''Support inclusion, as well as re-nomination, if necessary''' - It's become increasingly clear that this is not just another change-of-term resignation; Gen. Petraeus has held perhaps the four most relevant commands of the post-9/11 era ([[MNF-I]], [[CENTCOM]], [[ISAF]], and the [[CIA]]), and his resignation was highly unexpected, with some having previously speculated that he was on the way to higher office.  The Petraeus and [[Petraeus sex scandal]] articles seem to be of sufficient quality for inclusion.  I might suggest a different blurb, though, such as ''[[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA director]] and former [[General (United States)|four-star general]] '''[[David H. Petraeus]]''' resigns, citing [[Petraeus sex scandal|an extramarital affair with his biographer]].''''' — further, [[User:Francophonie&#38;Androphilie|''Francophonie&#38;Androphilie'']] sayeth naught ''([[User talk:Francophonie&#38;Androphilie|Je vous invite à me parler]])''''' 02:58, 14 November 2012 (UTC)

Furthermore, a lot of people are hearing about Petraeus right now, and we have a fairly high-quality article about him, so, in keeping with the purpose of ITN, I think that, regardless of ''why'' he's getting so much attention, we should provide Wikipedia readers with information pertinent to a story that's been on the front page of the ''New York Times'' website for the past four days.''' — further, [[User:Francophonie&#38;Androphilie|''Francophonie&#38;Androphilie'']] sayeth naught ''([[User talk:Francophonie&#38;Androphilie|Je vous invite à me parler]])''''' 03:34, 14 November 2012 (UTC)
* Francophonie is right on here. Well the media is stating that consensus among historians Petraeus was the best general since Eisenhower and the CIA is probably one of the most powerful "civilian" organizations in the world. This story being opposed for a sex scandal is just absurd to say at least. This has significant global implications within many countries including Iran, Pakistan and so forth.

:*Thank you for agreeing, but I differ on the matter or Clinton.  Petraeus's resignation is notable because it was unexpected; we've known that Clinton would resign for more than a year now, I believe.  Several people commented earlier that we should not include Petraeus's resignation because such things are commonplace when a president is elected to a second term; I agree with this in the abstract, but simply feel that it does not apply here.''' — <u><font color="#000000">[[User:Francophonie&#38;Androphilie|Francophonie&#38;Androphilie]]</font></u> ''(<u><font color="#000000">[[User talk:Francophonie&#38;Androphilie|Je vous invite à me parler]]</font></u>)''''' 06:23, 14 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Further Comment''' - May I suggest we use a blurb acknowledging that this now happened days ago, i.e. "growing controversy" over it? Additionally, as Francophonie notes in his proposed blurb, suggest working the [[Petraeus sex scandal]] into the blurb. Let's get this done here, then renominate up top and try again, as in my opinion ITN looks pretty silly ignoring the biggest political scandal of the year, with implications extending in multiple directions. Another general is now involved, domestic spying is being questioned, journalistic ethics are suddenly an issue... we need a clever, inclusive blurb that isn't too long.

**Wouldn't renomination be a waste of time? This can still be in the news a decade from now but the people here would still be opposed. It's interesting to note though that the BBC resignation is pretty split (5 support-5 oppose-2 other) vs. the CIA one (5-10-2), with a supporter in the BBC nom hailing the resignation of a BBC journalist, who is "of international standing," is of "global interest" while an opposer (that's not even a word) asking for "International repercussions" on the resignation, no matter the circumstances, of the CIA chief; that's pretty telling. –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 08:06, 14 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - As this planet is several times the mass of the earth, and is likely to have a highly eccentric orbit around a star that is not a lot like the Sun, I'm not sure this is as notable as it at first appears. As mentioned just before [[Alpha Centauri Bb]] made the headlines, exoplanet discoveries are coming very rapidly at present, so we have to set the bar pretty high. [[User:AlexTiefling|AlexTiefling]] ([[User talk:AlexTiefling|talk]]) 14:30, 8 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' Hundreds of planets have now been detected and this rate of discovery will continue for some time and probably even increase, so we need the circumstances to be particularly notable before featuring them on ITN. If it was the first Earth-sized planet in the HZ of a sun-like star then that would be notable, but anything aiming for that record but falling short just doesn't cut it.

*'''Comment''' - The new planet immediately placed [https://sites.google.com/a/upr.edu/planetary-habitability-laboratory-upra/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog in the top five most habitable known planets]. I'd say that makes it notable. [[User:Anxietycello|Anxietycello]] ([[User talk:Anxietycello|talk]]) 15:29, 8 November 2012 (UTC)
:*The planet has a minimum mass of 7 times the Earth, so is likely more like Neptune than the Earth. If it has been listed in the habitable-exoplanets-catalog then that just shows how silly and premature that catalog is. With a planet that massive, the pressure of the thick atmosphere will be such that by the time you reach liquids the temperature will be hundreds of degrees and the distance from its star will be irrelevant for habitability - you might as well say Neptune is habitable.

*'''Oppose'''- As per AlexTiefling, our bar has to be pretty high else we'll be posting an exoplanet every other week. This one, at minimum 7 earth-masses is almost certainly not habitable. The bar also needs to be slowly raised over time, I reckon within a few years we'll ve seeing actually life-viable be seeing Earth-sized planets in Goldilocks zones and eventually even those won't be hugely notable.

| nom cmt      = Okay, clearly the last nomination did not go well because there was a lot of people who opposed who did not either know key facts or did not realize the magnitude of LGBT rights wins in the US on election day. Additionally, some other pieces related to LGBT rights weren't nominated - which I am doing so now.

Firstly, these are HISTORIC wins - this is the FIRST time in both US and WORLD history that SSM has been enacted by VOTERS. Secondly, these wins were sweeping - 4 of 4 up for a vote. Also the first openly gay female US Senator was elected (historic!), and additionally an Iowa Justice (David Wiggins) who was part of the unanimous opinion in the Iowa Supreme Court which made gay marriage legal in Iowa was retained by voters (a COMPLETE and HUGE reversal of Iowans' previous vote to oust justices in 2012 -  there was a TEN PERCENTAGE POINT or so shift!). All these put together are huge, are being widely reported in the MEDIA (remember this is IN THE NEWS - so as long as it is widely reported and notable, it should be posted).

Also, some replies to opposing points explaining the facts:
*"3/50 US states just legalised SSM" - other states have SSM legal, so it is NOT 3/50, and these were the ONLY ones in which there were votes, so what do you expect?
*"Meh ... them and Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden. Along with 30 or 40 odd states that allow same-sex unions" & "Not the first states to do this and likely not the last." - FIRST TIME BY *VOTERS*, and no 30 or 40 odd states DON'T have same-sex unions!
*"I cannot realize a notability in the legalization of same-sex marriages in federal units of a country. Maybe it's worth supporting if the legalization was done in the United States, but in three of 50 states it's far from being something important." - the United States DOES NOT work that way, STATES are in control of marriage laws, the US Congress CANNOT legalize SSM across the United States. And again, only these were up for a vote, and ALL of them were swept up by LGBT rights advocates.
*Rest were similar arguments, so see above

*'''Oppose''' Since the gay marrage votes are being discussed separately I'll concentrate on the other two additions you suggest - both of which I very '''strongly oppose'''. Mainly for far too much hyperbole and CAPITAL LETTERS in the description you wrote. Believe me, if you write a description about how IMPORTANT and HISTORIC something is, that is NOT going to win over people to your side. 
:Anyway; on the topic of notability - this means nothing outside the United States and whilst the gay marriage votes do have at least a little external interest your additions go straight from just US interest to US-centralism. Why is the first gay US senator more important than the first gay British MP or first black Member of the German Bundestag or the first atheist member of the US Congress any other similar random 'milestone'? From what I know there are 100 senators and in this day and age I would expect none of them being gay would be more unusual, and I'm sure there were plenty that specific things could be picked out about. I recall hearing that the first Buddhist senator and Hindu congresswoman were elected too, do they deserve a place in the news? It's also worth pointing out that your claim of 'being hugely reported in the media worldwide' is far, far overstating it. The facts were most likely mentioned as trivial results to come out of the US election but really are not what the world deems as the important result. I mean I can go to BBC News's US&Canada page, there is a sub-sub-heading about "States approve same-sex marriage" and nothing on the specific people you talk about. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20231832 In one article] the election of the first openly gay senator is mentioned just as a side point, alongside similar trivia like the highest number of women ever. 
:The thing that annoys me most is your claims on an Iowa Justice ''a COMPLETE and HUGE reversal of Iowans' previous vote to oust justices in 2012 -  there was a TEN PERCENTAGE POINT or so shift!'' - that is the height of local politics and totally irrelevant to anyone else. If I said that one of the constituencies in the United Kingdom has a HUGE, HISTORIC change from the Conservative Party to Labour by 15% in the next election, perhaps one that had never had a Labour MP before etc... you might see just how irrelevant it is to anyone outside the affected area. I mean come on, David Wiggins doesn't even have an article, he hasn't even been elected but re-elected, there is no way that specific elections results like his fulfils the criteria to be in ITN.--[[User:Martin23230|'''<font face="Century Gothic" size="3">23230'''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:Martin23230|<font face="Century Gothic">talk</font>]]</sup> 14:33, 8 November 2012 (UTC)
**Well, at least you've reasoned out your argument well. So, in reply: 1.) Emphasis was needed, because some people seem to oppose proposed items here almost for the sake of it (or because they don't like it!)  2.) The additions are because they were often reported together as a watershed day for LGBT rights in the US in regards to the ballot box  3.) Let's be honest, I'm not an American myself, but surely we can all agree that US Senators tend to be more notable than members of other legislatures  4.) The wins all placed together is what makes them notable - it was a sweep (i.e. like the fact that it was widely reported that President Obama sweeped the battleground states - sweeps like this make items like these more notable)  5.)

*'''Oppose''' (after ec) - The 3/50 objection certainly still applies. If these were the ''first'' three states to legalise equal marriage, that would be more notable; but they aren't. As an LGBT person myself, I feel that this nomination is far too [[WP:POINT|pointy]], consisting far too much of a rant against people who opposed the previous (still-open) nomination. And frankly, the piecemeal way that the US handles this sort of legislation is not in itself a good argument to give more prominence to legislation from sub-national bodies. Did we cover the Scotland-only ban on smoking in public enclosed places? Did we cover the Baden-Württemberg headscarf ban? Do we ever cover local politics from Yakutia, the largest sub-national entity in the world? No amount of angry, shouty capital letters will ever make local legislation into international news. When genuine firsts are achieved by states, that's potentially notable. That's why I suggested including the recreational marijuana initiatives in a round-up of state votes. Simply talking about the election of specific politicians who happen to be LGBT in order to bolster a fairly small, local story seems a bit [[WP:COATRACK|arbitrary]] to me.

*'''Oppose''' - If it was a case where after an election, a super-majority of the states had some type of law allowing gay marriages (like, 45 of 50 or more), that might be something, but just a few state victories towards this in addition to various edicts from past elections doesn't make this a significant turning point in the issue.  --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 14:51, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

*Okay, clearly this is getting nowhere (although some of these appear too !vote-ish to me), admins can consider this '''withdrawn''' ''unless others wish to keep it open''. BUT: one question open to all editors to comment on: '''What do you consider to be something which should be posted in regard to this subject?''' At which point will the US be mentioned? Should we mention it when France, UK, etc does so (as their governments have announced?), should we mention it when [insert amount of US states here] have passed it? Should we mention it when any country does so? Or when a country has [insert level of population]? Up to how many countries should be posted? etc.. The reason why I'm asking this question is because postings related to this subject have seemed arbitrary at times - I mean, the NY state one was posted, and that was a legislature's action, but not four states in one go by voters? '''I think a clear guideline should be formulated for this subject at ITN'''. --[[User:Grotekennis|Grotekennis]] ([[User talk:Grotekennis|talk]]) 15:21, 8 November 2012 (UTC)
** Consider the issue like a high-profile court case, which in ITN we only report on the most significant point - the acquittal or the sentencing.  For gay marriage rights in the US, either a national law would be passed, or some significant majority (certainly not all of them because there are states that are so against it that it will unlikely ever come to pass in our lifetimes).  We'll know that point when it is noticed by the media, as it certainly isn't this current election cycle.  --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 15:26, 8 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Strong oppose'''- Just end this mess. The refutation of my previous reasoning was ridiculous. Saying that only 3 states ''voted'' on it makes it even less notable, because it emphasizes how little of an impact this really has. Percentages don't mean anything to SSM legalisation; its still only 3 states that voted to allow it.

*'''Comment''' this is a pretty big deal and would make the front page on a slow news day, but it is sort of a trivia issue. It is clear that over the last decade there has been a huge change in the rights and perception of the LYGB community, and it is very significant that voters approved the issue - it is more an acknowledgment that you have fully arrived, than anything else. Normally minorities never get their rights through a popular vote, as the majority trivially outvotes them, but as majority acceptance increases, votes follow. It is sort of like climbing a mountain, and realizing you are going to be able to reach the top even though you are just at the first base camp. So this is the point where LG etc. are at base camp. Voters tend to be too dumb to make smart decisions. And that is not a reflection on them - by definition the average IQ is 100, and the average IQ of successful politicians is barely higher, mostly because they are more relatable, but who in their right mind would select someone with an IQ of 100 to run a university or a corporation - yet we do that for a country? Fortunately the President contrary to popular expression, does not run the country. They do run the executive branch of the Federal government, but a country is much more than its government, and corporations have long been far more important in the U.S. than the Federal government. And nobody tells anyone what to do. Nobody. They can try, but it is not worth the paper it is printed on. Ask yourself, how many people actually stop at a stop sign or follow every speed limit? And how is that drug war working out? Billions spent and not one percentage change in drug use. And has the death penalty in Nigeria or Iran stopped even one person from being gay? Not likely.

*'''Support''' can't agree with the above argument that states do not count while countries do, that's nation-state biased. In federal systems states have high levels of legislative autonomy and here we talk about two states with a combined population of 12 million. That's more than the population of most countries, so don't see why state-level democracy would need to be ignored. Is particularly inconsistent with the other ITN phenomena of often considering accidents resulting in 10+ deaths newsworthy. --<small>[[User:Elekhh|ELEKHH]]<sup>[[User talk:Elekhh|T]]</sup></small> 22:07, 7 November 2012 (UTC)
**Very well. Calculating 2 out of 50 gives 4%, but 12 million out of 314 million doesn't change it either. Even if the level of autonomy of the states in the US is on a higher level (agree on it), it doesn't show that the news really does implications and many groups are aware of it. The comparison with some other countries with less population is completely off, because they usually earn much more international attention when legalizing such things. We cannot base our conclusions on population figures that don't coincide with the factual acceptance of the news worldwide. Should we, then, post each law approved by a single state in India, only because its population is much greater than the population of some sovereign countries? Claiming that the federal subjects in the United States are of large importance than those in other countries is not indented as an argument.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 22:38, 7 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Strong support'''. I have to humbly say that anyone opposing this inclusion has no clue just how big a deal this is. There is absolutely no state in the U.S. that has previously legalized marijuana, although it was rumored that the Republicans were going to legalize it nationally before the election to improve Romney's chances.

**I really don't think this is our "one and only chance to report it happening". There are presumably dozens of states in the future perhaps establishing the same law: which do we post?

*Well '''Support''' obviously as this is *ahem* notable, and is very likely to be updated within seconds. Question is, when do we post it? When CNN calls the election? When the FEC officially announces? When  the other guy concedes? The three parts (President, House and Senate) are likely to not be known at the same time. Also, should we use the phrases "is re-elected" "retains control of the house/senate"? There's advantages to having a discussion a little bit ahead of time about this, thanks Lihass for filing the necessary "paperwork".

**In my opinion the post should go with presidential results up when Obama/Romney officially concedes the race, with the senate and house bits added to the blurb when known.

***Major League Baseball is clearly the most premier baseball league in the world, and players from other countries strive to play there. That is reflected in the international nature of its rosters (esp. with players from Latin America). Many countries have professional baseball leagues (e.g. [[Division Élite]] in France), but I don't think any of them would argue they're on the same caliber as MLB in the U.S. That being said, Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan is probably the second most prestigious baseball league in the world, even if its players aren't as international. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 18:44, 3 November 2012 (UTC)

*****AFAIK, the Japan Series blurb was always combined with the World Series blurb; when it (World Series) is pushed off, it goes along with it.

*****Also, aren't Japan the defending [[World Baseball Classic|WBC]] champs? Japanese baseball has to be more followed than American baseball nowadays, right? The series-clinching crowd at the Tokyo Dome is quite higher than the [[2011 Emperor's Cup#Final]] (both featured Tokyo teams), and even higher than the World Series.

Several ITNR events haven't been posted regularly in recent years, including a lot of the rugby stuff, so if the Japan series wasn't posted for 1-2 years that's no reason to not post now.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 20:09, 3 November 2012 (UTC)
******To be clear, I was just answering Torsodog's question. I have no opinion about whether this should be posted. But we have to recognize that not all national baseball leagues (or sports leagues) are created equal. Whether we draw the line above or below NBP is a matter of opinion. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 20:24, 3 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' there is no need to bump up the US final, and without that, the Japanese final by itself is not notable enough to deserve an ITN entry. [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 19:08, 3 November 2012 (UTC)
**I'm not proposing a bump of the original blurb. I'm just proposing adding this to the blurb until it is bumped.

*'''Support''' a stand alone entry.  This is the top level championship of one of the most popular sports in Japan and one of the highest calibre leagues in the sport.  And, frankly, a counter to systemic bias. [[User:Resolute|Reso]][[User Talk:Resolute|lute]] 19:17, 3 November 2012 (UTC)
**It seems some who opposed the entry have no idea how big [[baseball in Japan]] is. It's even referenced a lot of times in the [[Detective Conan]] anime and manga. Aside from cricket's [[Indian Premier League]], when would an annual Asian sporting event stand a chance at ITN? –'''[[User:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">H</font>]][[User talk:Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">T</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck|<font color="#FFA500">D</font>]]''' 19:38, 3 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support'''' just the Japanese final. We post the English Premier League, and there's no indication that's "higher" than the Bundesliga, Serie A or La Liga (which we probably do or could post). This seems the same situation. I don't see the point of bundling it with the American final though, leave that as a separate entry as they're two different leagues.

*'''Support'''.  It's ITNR, and should be.  We don't have a lot of baseball on ITN.  We feature very little sport from Asia and this is clearly a major tournament worthy of mention.  It's the number one sports event in Japan, a country of 120 million.  We feature the [[Grey Cup]] championship of Canadian football (American football with a few rules differences) so I don't see why we can't feature the second most important baseball tournament as well.  This isn't some minor unnotable sports event.  On what basis exactly is anyone saying that the Japan series isn't notable enough on its own, btw?--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 20:04, 3 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support Separate Blurbs''' 2nd most notable baseball championship behind the [[World Series]], definitely should be posted. However, not as a combined blurb. This isn't like posting the combined mens and womens results of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], where it's the same tournament. They're separate, unrelated events, and should be treated as such. They are both notable enough to receive their own blurb. -- <span style="background:#000000">'''[[User:Anc516|<span style="color:#FFFF00">Anc516</span>]]'''</span> ([[User talk:Anc516|Talk]] ▪ [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|Contribs]]) 23:44, 3 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support and endorse readiness'''- Japan is better at baseball than the US, so this is at least as notable as the World Series. Japan won the [[2009 World Baseball Classic|most recent world championship]] and even the [[2012 Little League World Series|Little League World Series]], where the US gets half the teams because they host it.

*I'd like to support this, but I have some reservations. Most concerning is this quote from AP: "But competing with European countries for tallest building is playing in the minor leagues. There are nearly 60 buildings in North America, Asia and the Middle East that are taller..." --[[User:Bongwarrior|Bongwarrior]] ([[User talk:Bongwarrior|talk]]) 00:48, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' As Bongwarrior stated, becoming the tallest building in Europe is not exactly saying much. There are eight buildings in Dubai alone that are taller than this. The Empire State Building is taller, and it was completed eighty years ago. Given our English-speaking audience and the importance of London, the completion of the Shard received an especially high amount of fanfare (and perhaps wrongly so). It is/was a well-recognized and well-known building among people who follow these types of projects, but, really, that building was more an achievement for London (whose next tallest building was completed twenty years ago) than it was an achievement for Europe. And perhaps in retrospect, it shouldn't have been posted at all. But Moscow has a very healthy skyline, meaning this particular building isn't very notable even in the context of just Moscow itself: another year, another new addition to the city's burgeoning skyline. The next tallest building was completed just two years ago, and the Mercury City Tower is expected to be surpassed next year when/if the [[Federation Tower]] complex is completed. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 01:23, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
:*The ITN shouldn't wait for expectations that are going to happen in the next period, but to document what has recently happened. We'll have to see if there will be another building topping the list completed in 2013. That's not our job and you have a manipulating way to oppose an item. By the logic you have, we should oppose each building completed (even if the tallest in the world), because it's not located in a city of large interest for our readers and because there will be another one taller completed soon.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 08:31, 2 November 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - The claim in the blurb is not in the source. The building has not opened - it's only topped out. When the Shard reached this stage, we waited; in fact, we waited until its official unveiling. When this project reaches that stage, I will '''support''' its inclusion here. (In fact, the Shard itself is not yet open for business - I pass it on the way to work several times a week - but we agreed on the formal opening ceremony.)

*'''Oppose''' "Tallest Building" records are losing their notability, in my opinion. It used to be that building the tallest building was a crowning achievement. Nowadays, they're sprouting up all over the place. One could potentially sprout up somewhere in Europe 5 years from now that beats this one. Unless a building is built that beats the world record by a lot, I wouldn't support any "tallest building" blurbs. -- <span style="background:#000000">'''[[User:Anc516|<span style="color:#FFFF00">Anc516</span>]]'''</span> ([[User talk:Anc516|Talk]] ▪ [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|Contribs]]) 23:28, 3 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Hopefully later''' Either Mercury Tower hasn't been opened (as the blurb claims) or the article has not been updated. The fact that London's Shard tower [[Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates/July_2012#.5BPosted.5D_Shard_London_Bridge|was posted]] as the tallest building in the EU around its opening ceremony, speaks very strongly for posting this. Normally we would post the building once it tops out, but unfortunately this article is not any shape to be put on the front page right now. I hope the article's situation has improved once the building officially opens. --[[User:Hydrox|hydrox]] ([[User talk:Hydrox|talk]]) 09:17, 4 November 2012 (UTC)

**Riyadh is unquestionably one of the region's most influential cities. As far as global cites go, Riyadh is not only the capital city of the world's 2nd largest petrol exporter, the country with the second largest proven reserves, and a regional and pan-Arab "heavyweight", but is Saudi Arabia's most exalted city, aside from Mecca, virtually entirely due to its holiness and beatitude. Riyadh has one of the world's most avant-garde structures, two of them really. Its skyline is burgeoning, as are its industries besides the ubiquitous energy. Not to mention, it has been ranked as a "Beta World City", along with other such locales as Berlin, Cairo, Rome, Cape Town, and Rio.

*'''UPDATE'''-Since I have created an article per Doktorbuk, I have added a third alternative blurb to the deliberation, as well as updated the blurbs to reflect the current death toll. [[User:QatarStarsLeague|QatarStarsLeague]] ([[User talk:QatarStarsLeague|talk]]) 13:36, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''', although the article needs to be broken down into sections. [[User:ComputerJA|ComputerJA]] ([[User talk:ComputerJA|talk]]) 15:26, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
**Sure, but could you elaborate a little bit. Breaking down the article is a bit ambiguous. [[User:QatarStarsLeague|QatarStarsLeague]] ([[User talk:QatarStarsLeague|talk]]) 17:57, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
***It's suitably detailed, looks good, why break it? Looks fine.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/86.40.192.30|86.40.192.30]] ([[User talk:86.40.192.30|talk]]) 20:49, 2 November 2012 (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*For the record, every source used in the article uses the work "truck" not "lorry".  I've made changes to reflect that.

*'''Comment:''' Separate article is currently too short (need separate paragraphs) and is also under AFD now.

*Only oppose is on article quality, and I have added a third paragraph to meet requirements for new article. Also looks like it will survive AfD, so I say this is '''ready'''.

**So when will it be posted?[[User:QatarStarsLeague|QatarStarsLeague]] ([[User talk:QatarStarsLeague|talk]]) 19:30, 4 November 2012 (UTC)
***When an admin sees this. '''[[User:Bzweebl|<font color="#D60047">B</font><font color="#F0A000">zw</font><font color="#00A300">ee</font><font color="#0A47FF">bl</font>]]'''  ([[User talk:Bzweebl|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bzweebl|contribs]]) 19:34, 4 November 2012 (UTC)
****The AfD presents an issue though. If there were a clearer idea that this article should exist, I'd just close the AfD and post this to ITN. But that's not the case yet, and appearance on the Main Page is generally supposed to be a reason for speedy keeping an article when it was on the Main Page first. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 19:41, 4 November 2012 (UTC)

*Removing ready tag. AfDs take a week, so this probably won't be posted. No need for the tag then.
