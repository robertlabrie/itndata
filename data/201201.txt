* '''Support''' (as nominator) - This is a big story in the UK and brings an end to years of calls for him to lose it. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition have all been involved and it's been the lead story on news bulletins all over the country. Noteworthy because of how rare it is and because it's due to the part he played in the downturn we're all living through. --[[Special:Contributions/109.145.117.119|109.145.117.119]] ([[User talk:109.145.117.119|talk]]) 17:47, 31 January 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' - local story, not interesting or significant for anyone outside the UK.--[[User:BabbaQ|BabbaQ]] ([[User talk:BabbaQ|talk]]) 18:07, 31 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' - I find this a fascinating story that is likely to be of interest to a wide readership. Highly ITN-worthy, in my view. By the way, I am an American citizen, since that seems to be an issue here. Personally, I don't think it should be. Cheers!

*'''Support''' - There's no doubt that this is significant. It's comparable to one having a [[Congressional Medal of Honor]] revoked.--[[User:WaltCip|WaltCip]] ([[User talk:WaltCip|talk]]) 18:27, 31 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' - There have been only [[List_of_revocations_of_appointments_to_orders_and_awarded_decorations_and_medals_of_the_United_Kingdom#Knight_Bachelor|six revocations ever (if this article is in shape)]] since the dawn of the universe. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 19:13, 31 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' Time for British editors to make their case! This is very rare (see Chocolate Horlicks). It is highly, highly uncommon for people to have their titles revoked. It is highly rare for people to be AWARDED them (and some Americans have, of course, been awarded honouary titles). That Sir Fred has had his knighthood revoked is significant in many fields - business, politics especially - and is doubtlessly highly notable.

*'''Support''' not just because some fat cat banker lost the one of the highest civil honours available, but it was absolutely part of the mismanagement of banks in the UK, lending a helping hand to the economic "crisis" Europe finds itself in.  Of course, expect to see many arguments of limited interest outside the Eurozone but this is English language Wikipedia...  [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 22:08, 31 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''', albeit a mild one.  This is essentially a domestic political gesture of no wider significance.  Sure, it's a rare event but rare events happen all the time.  There's no real allegation of personal misconduct, this is merely another manifestation of the currently popular "give bankers a bloody nose" sentiment. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 22:27, 31 January 2012 (UTC).

*{{ec}}'''Support''' Agree with the point that Crispmuncher makes about this being a domestic political gesture, but the significance of that gesture, the fact the Monarch has got directly involved, is what makes me support.

*'''Leaning Oppose''' this is the third time since 1991 that somebody is stripped of knighthood. Considering that knighthood is not that notable outside UK, this is not that ITN worthy. [[User:Nergaal|Nergaal]] ([[User talk:Nergaal|talk]]) 00:02, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - I have to disagree with crispmuncher. This isn't simply a political gesture designed to appease the public. His knighthood was awarded for services to banking, yet he was personally responsible for bringing RBS, a bank that was once the biggest in the world, to a point of near collapse. He took huge risks and bought another bank with cash (ABN AMRO) that turned out to be a complete dud which lead to RBS needing taxpayer money to keep it going. The Honours Forfeiture Committee said that his holding a knighthood brought the honours system into disrepute. As to the argument that knighthoods aren't widely known outside the UK, everyone's heard of Sir Elton John and Dame Elizabeth Taylor, right? --[[Special:Contributions/109.145.117.119|109.145.117.119]] ([[User talk:109.145.117.119|talk]]) 08:32, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - I also have to disagree with crispmuncher. The banking story is huge, as noted above. Knighthoods are well known, from Sir Francis Drake, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sir Paul McCartney. This story should be posted without further delay; in my view, consensus has been reached and minority arguments against posting are not convincing.

*'''Blurb''' - I'm not happy with the blurb. It's different to the blurb I proposed even though nobody raised any objection during the above discussion. First of all, it should be 'Queen Elizabeth II'. Queen Elizabeth is just not the correct way to write her name and creates confusion. Second, it should be 'The Royal Bank of Scotland', not 'the Royal Bank of Scotland'. Pedantic maybe, but hey, I'm a pedant. Lets just get it right. --[[Special:Contributions/109.145.117.119|109.145.117.119]] ([[User talk:109.145.117.119|talk]]) 18:50, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
**You proposing a blurb doesn't necessarily mean it's the blurb that will end up being used. The fact that no one objected to the blurb is rather irrelevant as the discussion wasn't about the blurb but rather about the news item. In any case, your blurb ''did'' go up as you proposed, but was adjusted by a different admin, [[User:David Levy|David Levy]], who you should ask about it. [[User:Strange Passerby|Strange Passerby]] ([[User talk:Strange Passerby|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Strange Passerby|cont]]) 19:35, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
***Yeah, to be fair "Queen Elizabeth" is utterly wrong and needs fixing.  We're about 400 years beyond Queen Elizabeth, the current monarch is '''never''' referred to as such but ITN is such a flame-fest I'm reluctant to fix it.  Hopefully David Levy (or someone disinterested) can adjust this...  [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 19:44, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
****Can't somebody just fix it? It's a matter of fact, not opinion. Queen Elizabeth is wrong, Queen Elizabeth II is right. --[[Special:Contributions/109.145.117.119|109.145.117.119]] ([[User talk:109.145.117.119|talk]]) 19:47, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
*****I'm a bit taken aback by the assertion that the current monarch is "never" [[Queen Elizabeth|referred to as "Queen Elizabeth"]], and I certainly don't see how this could "create confusion" in a context obviously referring to a living person, but I've added the "II".<br />Our article is titled "[[Royal Bank of Scotland]]" and refers to "the Royal Bank of Scotland" throughout the prose (unless beginning a sentence).  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 20:00, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
******Well Queen Elizabeth, as I'm sure you're aware, was a 16th/17th century monarch and in no way similar to our current monarch who is never legitimately referred to as "Queen Elizabeth" (that's purely erroneous).  So thanks for fixing that.  As for RBOS, the company themselves call it "The Royal Bank of Scotland", regardless of our erroneous article title.  But since we go with reliable sources, not first-party sources, I guess this'll have to do.  [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 20:05, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
******It would be confusing in the same way that 'President Barack' would be confusing. It's just not right and everybody who knows it's not right would be confused as to why an encyclopedia is making such a basic error. I agree with The Rambling Man that any legitimate source knows that Queen Elizabeth is not right and the assertation that she is NEVER referred to as such is accurate if we are only basing it on credible sources. As for 'The Royal Bank of Scotland', the company's own website uses this format and therefore our article is wrong. Perhaps it has been stylised that way to conform to Wiki-standards which is fine, but it doesn't make it correct. --[[Special:Contributions/109.145.117.119|109.145.117.119]] ([[User talk:109.145.117.119|talk]]) 20:21, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
*******I'll take your word for it that referring to the current monarch as "Queen Elizabeth" is improper, but it's quite common among news media inside and outside the UK.<br />To be clear, I'm ''not'' defending the practice or arguing that we should follow suit; I'm explaining why I believed it to be acceptable.  I apologize for my confusion and thank the two of you for setting me straight.<br />If "The" is an official part of the bank's name, our article should be renamed/edited accordingly.  (This doesn't contradict Wikipedia's conventions.)  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 20:54, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
********I wouldn't say it's "improper", just inaccurate.  News media "inside" the UK don't say "Queen Elizabeth" ever, as far as I know, they just say "the Queen", so not sure where you get that idea from.  As for naming the bank, it's probably pretty common that articles slated for main page inclusion aren't named correctly, this is just another example of that.  [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 20:57, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
********There's really no need to apologise, David. I would be genuinely amazed if any reputable news media referred to her as Queen Elizabeth. --[[Special:Contributions/109.145.117.119|109.145.117.119]] ([[User talk:109.145.117.119|talk]]) 21:05, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

**********Actually, that is perfectly correct, as is a plain "Queen Elizabeth".  Lack of precision does not make it wrong, especially when who is being referred to is clear from the context.  Personally, I don't see why we are focussing so much on her anyway, she acted in name only, there was never any question of her not following the official request. We're generally not so pernickety about e.g. the Queen calling a general election, although constitutionally only she has that power. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 02:39, 2 February 2012 (UTC).
***********I ''thought'' that "Queen Elizabeth" was correct (and merely lacked precision unneeded in this context), but I've been told that it isn't.<br />My understanding is that the styling "Princess Diana" is improper because Diana was neither born a princess nor created one by the Queen.  ("Princess Charles" would have been correct, but it never entered popular use.)  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 02:52, 2 February 2012 (UTC)
************Diana ''was'' made a princess in her own right, in contrast to Kate Middleton who wasn't.  The reasoning given there is that she wasn't marrrying the next in line to the throne. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 11:06, 2 February 2012 (UTC).
*************Source?  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 16:04, 2 February 2012 (UTC)
***********I can see that my trust in respected news media was somewhat misplaced. I still believe that Queen Elizabeth is an incorrect way of referring to her. Perhaps it would be acceptable in an informal context I'm not sure, but certainly in an encyclopedia we should be using her correct name, which is Queen Elizabeth II. That's a good point about Princess Diana actually. Almost everybody refers to her in that way even though it has never been correct. --[[Special:Contributions/109.145.117.119|109.145.117.119]] ([[User talk:109.145.117.119|talk]]) 08:08, 2 February 2012 (UTC)
**Just reiterating I posted the blurb suggested here...I would agree that "Queen Elizabeth" needs the "II" on the end, so good move fixing that. I'm also wondering whether linking "knighthood" might be advisable, but beyond that the blurb looks alright to me the way it is now.

*Major case in Canada regarding so-called "Honor killings".  Been all over the news today.  The article is OK, and I know the update is a bit short, but hoping that attention here at ITN/C could encourage a bigger update regarding the conviction and reactions to it.  I'm a bit short on time at the minute, but hope to get on this as well in the near future.  Given the coverage in the news, this seems to be a newsworthy event, so I think that if we can add a paragraph or so of text on the conviction, it would be ITN worthy.

** According to the page, the gold medal game was attended by 2300 people, a pretty strong and objective indication that the sport is minor. Even the most sparsely attended regular-season Major League Baseball game will have a paid attendance almost five times that. Fourteen countries broadcast games from the tournament and ten broadcast the final--or, less than half of the countries than are showing this year's Super Bowl. Whether Europeans "see" baseball or American football as something akin to rhythmic gymnastics or waterpolo, objective facts are that they are not.

***It's completely inappropriate to compare a sports game played indoors with one played outdoors. Attendance of 2,300 spectators for a swim stadium with capacity of 3,000 makes it more than 75%. Five times that makes it 12,000 which is barely 25% of the average capacity for a baseball stadium.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 17:43, 30 January 2012 (UTC)
****I didn't bring up any comparison to baseball, just expanded on it. If there are no swim stadiums with a capacity over 3,000, well...see the first point. Evidently the demand just isn't high enough to justify it. Hockey and basketball are played indoors and most top-level teams would go under at the first game with a 2300-3000 attendance. The comparison was also between a gold medal game and a regular-season baseball game--no stadium in the U.S. would fail to sell out a World Series game. [[User:PeteF3|PeteF3]] ([[User talk:PeteF3|talk]]) 18:11, 30 January 2012 (UTC)
*****What is the point of mentioning 2300 attendance if that is the maximum of the venue? It's not comparable with football, or at least you then need to say, it's like 75000 people attending football final which all out of a sudden is no longer sounding so bad. And what do you think is the attendance of other sports with limited venues? How many people attend Formula 1 or ski jumping? However here is another number which I would like to hear a comment on - 2.749.000 people watched the game in Serbia alone, and that is not counting cable channels which also had it on, just the RTS station - [http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/Dru%C5%A1tvo/1035930/RTS+oborio+sve+rekorde.html]. That's about the third of a population, pretty much the same percentage as the [[Super Bowl]] in the US. How is that for irrelevant?--[[User:Avala|Avala]] ([[User talk:Avala|talk]]) 18:27, 30 January 2012 (UTC)

::"''On what basis was consensus clear?''" Ummm. No opposition at the time. "''Has receieved minimal media coverage in English.''" Hmmm. Those evil foreigners who don't speak Godzone!

"''small portion of the world''" I don't really want to reopen old wounds, but Joe Paterno?

*'''On the fence''': However, a '''point to consider against inclusion''' is that anti-piracy operations are/were quite common (at least through 2010 and early 2011). During this period, the Indian navy alone had 15+ operations (including the controversial sinking of a Thai trawler which had been converted to a mothership by the pirates) where around 30 pirates were killed, 140 captured (and taken to India for prosecution) and around 80 hostages rescued. I used the Indian navy as an example because I had been following these news reports - I am sure other navies, especially those part of the CTF-150 would have had similar or comparable operations. '''Points in favour''' would be that this is a land raid on Somali soil as opposed to Somali territorial waters and that this was a planned operation as opposed to a response to an SOS.

*'''A tip for American editors''' (...and desperately not wanting to be accused of anti-Americanism myself.) You really need to explain items like this a lot better. No-one from another country would try to nominate anything to do with an amateur sport in colleges, because it's simply not important anywhere else. America is different from the rest of the world in this area, and you CANNOT assume that people will just accept your claim that it's important just because you say so. For your own sake, and to reduce the level of argument here, please put your claim in a broader context that will be understood by people who aren't familiar with the significance of American colleges and sport. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 18:11, 22 January 2012 (UTC)
**I didn't nominate the item, but I think that since it's impossible for someone not familiar with American culture to understand in a paragraph why someone like Joe Paterno is so newsworthy, the best thing to do is to look at how the media play it. When Etta James died, it was a significant story, but it didn't bump the presidential election off the top of all of the big media websites like Joe Paterno did. I have no idea who the most important coaches in the UK are, but if someone were to tell me that (for example) the BBC interrupted their programming to announce his death and that the Times dedicated the top of its front page to the subject, I'd be convinced that it was a noteworthy event. The best I can do to explain is to say that college football is a gigantic sport in the United States that attracts near-religious devotion from many of its millions of fans, that Joe Paterno was in charge of one of the biggest college football programs for four decades and that he was among the most-revered figures in American life until a mind-blowing scandal that shocked the country last year. The main reason why I shy from ITN nowadays is because it is so maddening to come face-to-face with people saying things like that the death of an extreme-sport athlete known by perhaps one out of every thousand North Americans before her death is "much more notable" than the death of one of someone who could have walked down any street in America and be recognized by most of the people he passed (who would have gone apeshit at the sight). It's like a scientist coming across a creationist who tries to argue that the planet is 6,000 years old. -- [[User:Mwalcoff|Mwalcoff]] ([[User talk:Mwalcoff|talk]]) 18:30, 22 January 2012 (UTC)
**::Yes, how the media play it could be useful, although with the major sites (e.g. BBC) now tailoring content to where a viewer is, that's becoming harder to do. What's important is that it's not up to non-American editors to go looking for those relevant media sites. Why should they? It's up to the Americans, particularly the nominator, to do it. The nomination and blurb here still give no explanation to a non-American as to why an amateur sports coach in a school, unknown outside America, is important. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 21:51, 22 January 2012 (UTC)
***I have to agree the Sarah Burke comparison was pretty warped.  That said, I'd say the comment 'one of the most revered figures in American life' is a bit of a stretch as well.  But I do think Joe Paterno is extremely notable ''right now'' having been the subject of a very significant university scandal.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 18:43, 22 January 2012 (UTC)
****Thanks for the explanation Mwalcoff, though you seem to have overdrawn some things. This death is really very well covered in North America and possibly makes some influence on other things, but it doesn't mean any notability at all. I see it is mentioned on the front page on many news portals in North America, but frankly with no echo in the other media. Even BBC did not mention his death on the front page of its sports news portal, although American sports news usually are so. For the comparison that I've made with Sarah Burke I guess not to be the only one who claims this death is by far least transmitted through the media.

He is certainly a household name. [[User:Calathan|Calathan]] ([[User talk:Calathan|talk]]) 00:34, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
**I guess we gonna fight about every "well known coaches of any sport in the United States" that do something every week, "the coach of Chicago Bulls get rich is ITN", hope wiki is more that ESPN --[[User:Feroang|Feroang]] ([[User talk:Feroang|talk]]) 00:48, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
***I certainly can't name the coach of the Chicago Bulls, nor do I have any interest in anything that he does.  I think you are really underestimating how well known Paterno is in the United States. [[User:Calathan|Calathan]] ([[User talk:Calathan|talk]]) 01:26, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' - This guy was "larger than life." Sports figures are over-rated, IMO, but Paterno was one of the most famous and admired coaches of any sport in the United States for more than 4 decades. Also, although he died a natural death at age 85, he was active -- and still at the top of his game -- until a couple of months before he died, and his retirement was due to a bizarre scandal that continues to have repercussions outside football. (Among other things, the scandal caused the university president to resign and it has led to a lot of adult men reporting long-ago sexual abuse by youth coaches.) --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 00:51, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' - does not meet the criteria for posting death. The [[Wikipedia:In the news#Deaths|criteria]]  #1 & #3 clearly  are not relevant, that leaves #2, and as he never coached at the highest level of his field ([[NFL]]) and only coached non-professionals he does not pass that either.

**** Paterno could have coached in the NFL; he chose not to. (This is discussed in his [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/sports/ncaafootball/joe-paterno-longtime-penn-state-coach-dies-at-85.html?pagewanted=3 NYT obit], among other places.)

Not a particularly successful coach with regard to winning championships or producing professional players on a per annum basis (see [[List of college football coaches with 200_wins]] and sort by percentage).

*'''Comment''' I don't see anyone in the opposition addressing the fact that we had a precedent - back in November, we posted the fact that he was fired (along with a university administrator). I think it's fair to say that the death of someone is more notable than the fact that he lost his job.

:*Yeah and saying he isn't very notable in collegiate American football in nonsensical. With two national championships and more wins than any other coach in the game, he's probably going to be ''the'' most notable collegiate American football coach ever brought here. I'll have to come here more often and vote oppose based on "British-centric" when I see some silly cricket player die. — [[User:Moe Epsilon|<font color="DD0000">Moe</font>]] [[User talk:Moe Epsilon|<font color="0000FF">ε</font>]] 06:01, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
::*But that would be stupid. Cricket is played professionally in a lot more countries than American football is. Oh, I just remembered, this ain't even professional sport... Don't worry, I'm not opposing the nomination. I'm opposing poor quality posts. As I said earlier, when a nomination IS relevant to only one country, those nominating really have to work a little harder to explain why, and not make dumb comments like that cricket one. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 06:50, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
:::*I think you're confusing my tongue-in-cheek comment for ignorance. The point is exactly that, cricket is known and played internationally, however if you asked the average American to even name a cricket player, they wouldn't be able to tell you one. The "I don't know who this is", "this is American-only" argument is flawed pending what country you live in. You and others stupidity in not realizing this is astonishing. I don't think you have to be a genius to realize that a coach or player ''in any sport'' at ''any level'' who has been the most successful (and Joe Paterno is the most successful college football coach of all-time, holding more victories than anyone) is notable for being listed here when they die. On top of that, he was entwined in the same sex scandal that you featured on ITN a month or so ago. The "they had to die in a notable way" logic below falls through as well, as Etta James died of leukemia which is no more a notable way to die than cancer. So what exactly is your reasoning? Is this because his death is not reaching international media attention or because American football isn't an international sport? — [[User:Moe Epsilon|<font color="DD0000">Moe</font>]] [[User talk:Moe Epsilon|<font color="0000FF">ε</font>]] 10:25, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
::::*Did you miss where HiLo said "I'm not opposing the nomination"? Also, I'd dispute your assertion that he is the most successful of all time. As far as I can see, he only won the most games because he coached the most games. Surely someone like [[Bear Bryant]], who won six national championships, was more successful? [[User:Jenks24|Jenks24]] ([[User talk:Jenks24|talk]]) 10:41, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
:::::*Success in sports is only measured in two ways primarily, championships and number of wins. Paterno won two championships, and had more wins than anyone. I'm not going to dispute Bear Bryant having more championships, and it's a useless comparison since both are very, very notable college football coaches. The point is American football not being an international sport should not be grounds to dismiss the all-time winningest college football coach dying, the same coach that was just fired from his 50 year old job after a well-known scandal ITN covered along with his firing. — [[User:Moe Epsilon|<font color="DD0000">Moe</font>]] [[User talk:Moe Epsilon|<font color="0000FF">ε</font>]] 10:48, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
:*He died of old age, I presume. Not controversial this time. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 06:50, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
:*I neither support nor oppose this item, but I disagree that the earlier instance set a precedent applicable to this one.<br />Firstly, I oppose the concept of ITN "precedents" (not to be confused with the sort of long-term consensus documented at [[Wikipedia:In the news/Recurring items]]).  It's reasonable to note what we've done in the past (especially if it's occurred frequently) as evidence of consensus or to challenge a particular editor's inconsistent arguments, but the fact that "we posted x" or "we didn't post x" doesn't automatically mean that we ''must'' do the same with y.  The community sometimes makes mistakes (and shouldn't be doomed to repeat them).<br />Secondly, as was argued at the time, the November posting stemmed from a major scandal affecting far more than Joe Paterno's employment.  As HiLo noted, Paterno's death of natural causes simply isn't comparable.  (Had he been murdered or committed suicide in response to the controversy, the situation would differ.)  —[[User:David Levy|David Levy]] 09:41, 23 January 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''. Obscure figure outside of the U.S. and, from the limited knowledge I've just read about him, wasn't actually involved in any major/top league American football, which makes his notability questionable. [[User:000peter|Peter]] ([[User talk:000peter|Talk page]]) 11:19, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
:*For coaching American football, the NFL isn't really a higher level than coaching the most popular university teams.  Joe Paterno turned down NFL coaching jobs, and as another example, [[Nick Saban]] left a NFL coaching job to take one of the top college coaching jobs.  The top college teams actually play at larger stadiums than the NFL teams (Penn State's stadium is the 4th largest in the world according to [[List of stadiums by capacity]]).

Currently we have 4 US-based stories but these should 100% be up there.

::That's funny. Nobody has actually accused this of being US-centrism. Several have said that it's only relevant to the United States, which is obviously true.

*'''Oppose''' - when one of the world's [[Johannes Heesters|most famous opera stars]] died last month his death failed to make it to the Main Page because "most people outside the German speaking world knew who he was". As for me, I am not American and I have no idea who Mr. Paterno was. First time I heard of him it was because of some scandal and the second time he made the news was because he died. As famous and well-known as he may have been in his country and state, I doubt someone in Africa or Russia or China would have any idea who he is.

*'''Oppose'''.

*'''Oppose''' Tragic, but far from being notable. Death of an active sportsperson in freestyle skiing with decent regard and conspicuous silence outside the sport does not suffice inclusion. Freestyle skiing is a sport with wide variety of disciples, but superpipe is even not among the most popular in broader terms. In addition, the news was announced as a secondary sports news.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 02:22, 20 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. @ Kiril: "Death of an active sportsperson in freestyle skiing with decent regard and conspicuous silence outside the sport does not suffice inclusion." Why doesn't it? An Olympic athlete killed in a sports-related accident is not notable? What if she died from some rare event, like lightening or something? Very notable individual killed at a very early age supported by wide-spread international coverage. Seems to meet the threshold for inclusion. And considering the slow week it has been outside of the SOPA drama this would appear to be a solid posting.

::I think she's not so notable. It's true that she did a lot for the fast-growing popularity of the sport and the death came suddenly, but the notability is limited to a sports circle that is hardly popular among the other sports. On the other hand we used to be strict regarding the deaths of sportspeople in the past and other notable sportspeople in more popular sports, such like [[Kamila Skolimowska]] and [[Pavel Karelin]] were not included, so I don't see a reason why to do it right now.--[[User:Kiril Simeonovski|Kiril Simeonovski]] ([[User talk:Kiril Simeonovski|talk]]) 02:41, 20 January 2012 (UTC)

===[Posted] SOPA blackout===
Given the particular problems that the blackout will pose for ITN, which generally takes a day to make up its mind, I have started this section now for discussion on whether/what we will post about SOPA action by Wikipedia and other sites. By getting ready now, we have 24 hours to ensure that we have a good, neutrally worded draft with broad support behind it. It would thus be ready to post when the blackout ends, provided that it receives significant coverage; in my opinion that is a foregone conclusion, as is the fact that the article will be significantly updated.

**Misleading and frankly both the blurb and article are rushed. The current blurb makes it sound like Wikipedia was the ringleader of the blackout movement, and even if it didn't, the focus should be on the blackout, not on Wikipedia's participation. Something less self-involved would be better, like "Several high profile websites take part in '''a campaign''' to protest against [[Stop Online Piracy Act|SOPA]] and [[PROTECT IP Act|PIPA]]", and expand the target article to cover the whole protest, not just Wikipedia's action. Wikipedia is not the primary focus of the majority of news articles I've read, nor should its participation in ''a larger event'' be the centrepiece of our own coverage. There were a number of high profile participants in the protests, of which Wikipedia was just one.

Furthermore, ITN was woefully outdated, even accounting for the blackout period. No worries, however; if a couple more people agree with your change, I/we can implement it. --[[User:Slakr|<span style="color:teal;font-weight:bold;">slakr</span>]]<small><sup>\&nbsp;[[User talk:Slakr|talk]]&nbsp;/</sup></small> 07:18, 20 January 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' we have multiple bombs blowing up in Iraq weekly now. I am unsure how these should be handled ITN-wise.

**'''Comment''' Not a fair enough reason to oppose. The amount of death is far greater than before, and is unique in the fact that it targeted pilgrims during a religious time. [http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/iraq-death-toll-attack-pilgrims-now-53-15360435#.TxHx0KWXTTQ Fears of more bloodshed have risen in recent weeks, with the U.S. no longer enjoying the leverage it once had to encourage the two sides to work together to rein in extremists.].

***'''Comment''' I missed my chance to oppose the frogs. I still might do so out of principle. Back on topic though, this is probably notable enough for an article, but not ITN unless it was something significantly out of the ordinary.

*'''Comment''' Notability of the event itself shouldn't be the only factor in our decisions. One of the main factors I consider is whether we have an informative, interesting article on the subject that tells readers something useful.

***'''Response''' True, or Canada, Australia, Denmark, Argentina or a host of other countries where there isn't a weekly bombing. For better or worse, the consensus seems to be that violence in a country where violence is common is less newsworthy than where it isn't. Part two of that is how many bombings in Iraq are not making headlines. A bomb killing zero people in Vienna might still be news, how many bombs go off every day in Iraq? --[[Special:Contributions/76.18.43.253|76.18.43.253]] ([[User talk:76.18.43.253|talk]]) 00:11, 16 January 2012 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Editor's personal views don't determine notability. An event covered by a wide-range of sources that continues to make headlines is rejected because it happens frequently in Iraq. Once a month or so these types of bombings occur. The large death toll cannot be ignored. Odd to see trivial frog news is okay, but massacres in Iraq are shrugged off.

***** I'm happy for the blurb to contain the words "Republic of China" as that is the current title for the article on the government of Taiwan, but we need to mention Taiwan as well.

Our naming conventions dictate what names we use, and in this case there is no ambiguity whatsoever that we ought to use ROC or ROC-TW in the articles and the blurb (and certainly not the term Taiwan on its own). You seem to have a problem not only with the blurb but with the entire NC-TW policy and the naming conventions that we have been using for years (see the previous election articles). I'm sorry, but consensus rules, and your objection here is out of place. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 22:07, 14 January 2012 (UTC)
******I have problems with several Wikipedia policies. My reasons are rational and clearly stated above. If policy allows supporters of Taiwan to play politics here, so be it, but it doesn't mean I will endorse it. ''China'' is that huge country on mainland Asia, not this place. I still strongly '''Oppose'''. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 22:20, 14 January 2012 (UTC)
*******So you understand that your opposition is with regard to WP:NC-TW, and not this blurb. Yet you still choose to whine and moan here, rather than in the policy's talk page. You know that is disruptive, correct? <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 22:23, 14 January 2012 (UTC)
********No, my position is supported by Wikipedia's policy to use common names (which I can't be bothered looking up the proper name of, but I KNOW you know what I mean.) Using ''China'' to describe this country is non-neutral POV. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 22:41, 14 January 2012 (UTC)
*********WP:COMMONNAME doesn't ''always'' apply (it states that we should ''generally'' use the most common name); that's why we have WP:NC-TW guidelines to specifically settle disputes about the PRC/ROC naming issue. This is the way it has been done for over 5 years; it makes no sense for us to diverge from it now just because you got "fooled" as a result of your ignorance. <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 22:44, 14 January 2012 (UTC)
**********If anyone gathered a coherent set of evidence about how the Republic of China is named, and managed to get enough non Taiwanese-partisans to participate in the move discussion then Republic of China would move to Taiwan per [[WP:COMMONNAME]] and [[WP:POVTITLE]]. 
**********It is certainly legitimate for people to be fooled about the Republic of China, it is literally never called that in English. -- [[User:Eraserhead1|Eraserhead1]] &lt;[[User_talk:Eraserhead1|talk]]&gt; 00:00, 15 January 2012 (UTC)

**Again, contrary to Wikipedia policy [[WP:NC-TW]]. Comments like this are tiring. It's not that hard to understand this: ''When there is an existing policy, we follow it. When you have an objection regarding the policy, take it to the policy talk page.'' Any other objection on any other location is completely worthless and valueless. Simply because you've never heard of the policy before is not a valid reason to object to it in one specific place and expect us to create a huge inconsistency.

***Tone it down a bit there, big fella. I am well aware of NC-TW, having argued against it in the past: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_%28Chinese%29&diff=prev&oldid=437465640]. You are downright wrong to call this a policy. NC-TW is not a policy, it is a naming convention -- a guideline -- to which exceptions "may apply". It is a "general rule of thumb", from which we are free to depart. We should do so here, because ''no-one'' is reporting this as the "Republic of China" election and we should follow, as always, what the reliable sources say. Have a cup of tea, take a break from your keyboard mashing for a while, and read [[WP:POLICY]]. --[[User:Mkativerata|Mkativerata]] ([[User talk:Mkativerata|talk]]) 22:40, 14 January 2012 (UTC)
****It does not matter whether the name ROC or Taiwan is used more often in mainstream English media. Articles on ITN follow Wikipedia guidelines; how other news organizations report it is none of our business. Sure, you're right that we can "ignore all rules"; so far you've not provided a convincing reason to do so.  <b><font color="gray">[[User:Jim Sukwutput|Jim]][[User_talk:Jim Sukwutput|Sukwutput]]</font></b> 22:59, 14 January 2012 (UTC)

****I'm in Australia. I just checked all our major reliable news sources. Every one of them used just ''Taiwan'' for this news, and didn't use the word ''China'' at all. Oh, except for one. It said "''China-friendly leader wins Taiwan re-election''". Clearly the name ''China'' is simply not used to mean ''Taiwan'' here. I don't think Australia is on any particular political or reporting extreme, and it certainly shows where my views come from. So, Wikipedia's or Jim's policies notwithstanding, I'm sticking with total opposition to the word ''China'' being mentioned. It's confusing, unhelpful, and political POV pushing [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 00:38, 15 January 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''' posting. Neutral on whether "Republic of China" is used, provided that (Taiwan) remains in brackets if it is. Either way, just get on with posting; there's no reason that this debate can't continue once it's up. —[[User talk:WFCforLife|WFC]]—  23:48, 14 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support'''. Even if considered only a Chinese domestic event, this is important news with international implications. Some people here make good points about the naming of Taiwan-related articles. They should join the active debates about this issue at [[Talk:Republic of China]] and [[Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)]].

====Iranian nuclear scientist assassinated====
{{ITN candidate|article=Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan |blurb=Iranian nuclear scientist '''[[Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan]]''' assassinated in a car-bomb explosion, prompting calls in Iran for retaliation against the West. |sources=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16501566 BBC], [http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/11/us-iran-idUSTRE8090ZL20120111 Reuters], [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/13/world/middleeast/iran-outrage-over-scientist-killing-deepens-as-it-signals-revenge.html?ref=world New York Times], [http://news.yahoo.com/iran-accuses-israel-us-killing-nuclear-scientist-035230434.html AFP]}}
The assassination produced a furious reaction in Iran; the kind of an event that makes some kind of a military blow-up between Iran and the West more likely. [[User:Nsk92|Nsk92]] ([[User talk:Nsk92|talk]]) 20:09, 13 January 2012 (UTC)

====Scottish independence referendum, 2014====

:'''Strong oppose'''. We have this discussion every year, and every year we come to the same conclusion. Sports stories at the university level are not significant enough for ITN. We post sporting competitions which are at the very pinnacle of the professional game in significant/popular sports, because they are the ultimate test of competitors in those sports. University sport does not meet that threshold, regardless of how many people watch it.

:'''Strong oppose''' per Modest Genius. Sports story at a university level doesn't even deal with a professionalization and is even far from the notability of a junior tournaments played in the most popular sports. Since this is college football, a variety of American football that I doubt that many people outside North America have even heard of it, it's clear that it doesn't meet the threshold.

Nearly every argument here is drastically over interpreted as in favor of 'oppose'.  We have this argument every year and every year we reach no consensus after much argument.  The 'no precedent' argument barely holds water.  Again, it's not that there's a consensus that this shouldn't be posted, it's that there's no consensus either way.  The NCAA basketball championship was posted the last two years (over many strong objections similar to those above), so there is some precedent for posting a similar sporting event.  Many sporting events are posted at ITN that nobody in North America cares about (handball, netball, snooker, etc).  This is a major event in North America.  In fact, opposing on the basis that nobody cares outside N America or any other region is [[Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates#Please_do_not...|specifically prohibited as an argument]].  Frankly a lot of people seem close minded on this issue (e.g. 'no mater how many people watch it'); to quote another ITN editor here, the 'the opposers won't listen to any arguments'.  And btw, Modest Genius, the finalists are not chosen by journalists at all.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 17:22, 11 January 2012 (UTC)
:::According to our article on the subject, [[BCS National Championship Game]], they're chosen by ' '''media''', former players and coaches, and [...] computer rankings' (emphasis added). And I'd bet that a large fraction of the 'former players and coaches' now work for media organisations.

:::John, you seem to have a very little of arguments to compare this with handball. For netball and snooker it makes more sense, but only on the base of its popularity. On the other hand, you apparently omit the fact that this is far from being a professional sports event and even if we consider it a variety of American football its popularity is limited to barely 50 countries with official federation, while for handball it counts more than 130. Only as a college football I doubt there is an independent governing body. For HTD, please calm down when blaming somebody for permanently opposing U.S.-centric stories.

*The crux of the opposition is that people outside of the United States don't want collegiate sports to be major news events. This, however, does not mean that these are not major news events. Not wanting them to be major events, and them actually not being major events, are completely different things. The fact remains that this is the national championship game of a very popular sport in the United States. The incidental facts of the sport, regarding where it is played, etc. is completely irrelevent to its importance. Expressing incredulity that the sport is popular doesn't instantly make it unpopular. Why do we not let the news sources speak for the newsworthiness of the event? That seems to me to be the most important argument, not whether or not we want college sports in America to be a big deal. Remember, not wanting Americans to care so much about college football doesn't make them not care. --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 03:31, 12 January 2012 (UTC)

This year may have had the lowest viewership ever, but that is more relative to the medium (ESPN) and poor game (21-0 blowout) than the popularity of the event.  Even with its lowest viewership ever, it still had more than most NBA/MLB/Stanley Cup etc championships.

:::::The Stanley Cup Finals were watched in numerous countries. In Canada alone, the final game averaged 8.5 million viewers, and over 18 million watched it at least in part.  That, I would mention, is greater than half the population of the country. [http://puckthemedia.wordpress.com/category/2011-stanley-cup-playoff-ratings/]  The Rugby World Cup also has a far greater worldwide draw.  Is the BCS championship one of the premier competitions in the world? No.  Not even remotely close.  It is doubtful that many outside of the US gives a damn.  One of the premier in the United States?  Absolutely.  But there is no "anti-American" bias involved in the concept that single-nation sporting events that are not at the highest level of their sport is not worthy of ITN.  As I said, the second most important tournament in Canada - the World Junior Hockey Championship (which obliterated attendance records at over 570,000 tickets sold) wasn't listed.  It wasn't anti-Canadian (or anti-Swedish, since they won the gold) bias that led to that result.

ITN is not a provider for interesting news; when we evaluate a nomination, we look at long-term significance and ''encyclopaedic'' potential (where we can write about it in an encyclopaedic way, rather than simply reporting the news). This event does not have either; therefore it would take an extraordinary amount of interest for us to include it.

This year saw another [http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-01/01/content_14367910.htm significant expansion] of the system on New Year's Day: Line 9, Line 15, and Line 8. This amounts to 36 km more tracks, and 19 brand new Subway stations in operation. In addition, although this milestone is not mentioned in English-language media, the new addition of tracks now makes Beijing Subway the third-longest system in the world, surpassing the New York City Subway for the first time. Last year during the ITN post, we discussed the dearth of infrastructure coverage on WP's ITN. With that in mind I submit this blurb.

*'''Support''' ...I guess. This IS news. Two VERY different appointments. While never a fan of John Howard's, this will stoke the fading fires over his Prime Ministership, and because of the controversy, may even help the Republican cause in Australia. [http://www.theage.com.au/national/queens-special-gift-for-howard-20120101-1phaq.html [[The Age]]] tells us that the award "is to be given ''to such persons, subjects of Our Crown, as may have rendered exceptionally meritorious services in Our Crown Services or towards the advancement of the Arts, Learning, Literature, and Science or such other exceptional service as We are fit to recognise.''" So, Hockney got it for his services to the arts, and Howard for having "rendered exceptionally meritorious services in Our Crown Services". It wouldn't have been in the other fields. [[User:HiLo48|HiLo48]] ([[User talk:HiLo48|talk]]) 22:04, 1 January 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''' David Hockney turned down a knighthood some years ago, so this is of interest and is notable. I agree that the appointments are interesting and as a 'curiosity' fits well with ITN criteria [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 09:02, 2 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''.

:: If I was to oppose the [[Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates#2011 Los Angeles arson spree|2011 Los Angeles arson spree]] above with the comment "is relevant only to a very small minority of states in only one country" would that be an acceptable oppose ?

::: If I'm correct, the last time we didn't post it was [[Neil MacGregor]] in 2010 and last year there was no award. Also, since 2000, there were 15 appointments, therefore it's not that rare in fact. --'''[[User:Tone|Tone]]''' 08:07, 3 January 2012 (UTC)

::::: Looking at the archives, I don't find any nominations related to the recent appointments of the order.

*'''Oppose''' per Ghmyrtle. --[[User:Mkativerata|Mkativerata]] ([[User talk:Mkativerata|talk]]) 08:12, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''--Those of us unfamiliar with the Order of Merit's significance probably have a hard time judging this award's notability, and to be convinced may need some independent evidence of it.  I've checked the BBC News website several times regarding this one and it's featured on the page but [[Below the fold|below the fold]].  I checked the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] and didn't see mention of this on its front page.  Given the lack of prominent placement of this story in media that one would assume would be biased towards it, I have to say I don't see evidence that this award is all that significant.  Lots of people are knighted.  [[Jonathan Ive|Jony Ive]] for example.  How is Hockney's or Howard's OoM more notable?  I appreciate that it's limited to 24 living people but I don't believe that's enough.--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 12:20, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. The award is limited to only 16 countries, with the total population of 135 million. Insufficient international impact and significance. [[User:Nsk92|Nsk92]] ([[User talk:Nsk92|talk]]) 15:01, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
:'''Reply''' Why do you see exclusivity as being non-notable? It surely tells you the opposite? [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 21:20, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
::That's absurd. Generally, the greater the number of potential competitors for a particular award, the greater its prestige. That's why being a national champion in a particular sport is less prestigious than being an olympic champion in the same sport. By your logic, a staff award in an office of 10 people is more prestigious than a Nobel prize - surely the former is "more exclusive" as only 10 people are eligible for it. What really matters is selectivity (applying high standards to a wide field of applicants), not exclusivity (which is limiting the number of people eligible for an award) . [[User:Nsk92|Nsk92]] ([[User talk:Nsk92|talk]]) 22:27, 3 January 2012 (UTC)
 
*'''Oppose'''. Was on the fence, but this reeks of systemic bias. Yes, it's important in the British isles, but there's no significance elsewhere.

:Hmm, could be an interesting addition.
