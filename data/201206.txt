:well i certainly learnt something new today...and it is in the news. Havent tagged as a minority topic, but it ''could'' be construed as a tech topic..
:I would suggest a "background" section for the terminology, etc.[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 20:37, 30 June 2012 (UTC)
::Unfortunately, I failed to notice that this article was already mentioned yesterday under "Disasters".  FWIW, I found the news coverage of the event
::frustratingly silent on the causes for the severe weather. The original version of the Washington Post article I linked characterized the weather system as
::a [[Bow echo]], which led me to Wikipedia. The NOAA [http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/md1316.html  Mesoscale Discussion] for the event describes
:: it as a [[Derecho]]. These two appear to be types of [[Mesoscale convective system]]s, but are not linked from that article.

:::The problem is that this is the type of news story that would fail [[WP:NEVENT]] in that we have no idea of its long-term impact.  Yes, there were deaths, but the numbers are small.  Tehre was some damage, but I've seen tornado strikes with more monetary effect than this seems to have.

:::::True, suggesting at least to me that it would make sense to have some type of series of articles "Severe Weather Events in 2012".  Certain events (hurricanes that make landfall, or the like, that have millions/billions in damages) would likely get separate articles, but for this current system, it still doesn't seem to be a long-term significant though arguably there's people that aren't expected to get power back for a week.  I feel its not far enough in terms of total damage (both in human losses and financial aspects) to make it an article to start with. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 17:32, 2 July 2012 (UTC)
*The "blurb" listed before wasn't really a blurb at all, so I've written a new one. I'm not very tied to it however. Not sure whether the main article should link from ''"An intense progressive dereco"'' or ''causes''. Standard form would be the former but I think we need a link to [[derecho]] in the blurb as most people won't know what that term means. [[User:LukeSurl|LukeSurl]]<sup> [[User Talk:LukeSurl|t]] [[Special:Contributions/LukeSurl|c]]</sup>
*:I've also removed "derecho" from the list of articles to update, as this is a general article about the phenomenon that does not require updating with regards to this event.

*'''Support''' Lack of power in a large chunk of the US alone is a significant event in my opinion, especially when the temperatures in these areas has been in the 80's - 100's (Fahrenheit). 3+ million people losing power for a lengthy time period (over 24 hours) is a big deal. Front page media coverage in the international edition of CNN, as well as on BBC and Reuters, so this is getting coverage around the world, not just in the US. -- <span style="background:#000000">'''[[User:Anc516|<span style="color:#FFFF00">Anc516</span>]]'''</span> ([[User talk:Anc516|Talk]] ▪ [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|Contribs]]) 06:18, 1 July 2012 (UTC)
::'''Question''' <s>Did we post, or even nominate, the giant snowstorm that hit the northeastern US last fall (where 1-2 feet of snow fell well before snowfall usually occurred)? I can't find it, and can't remember when it happened.</s> That had similar effects as this storm for the [[New England]] area, with many people losing power for more than a week. '''Edit''' here it is: [[2011 Halloween nor'easter]]; it was added to Did you Know, but not to ITN, unless I'm missing something. Despite that storm not making it, I would still support the posting of this. Does anyone remember if this was even nominated? -- <span style="background:#000000">'''[[User:Anc516|<span style="color:#FFFF00">Anc516</span>]]'''</span> ([[User talk:Anc516|Talk]] ▪ [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|Contribs]]) 06:18, 1 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Weak support''' per Anc. [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 07:19, 1 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' - notable and unusual weather event; comparing it to the snowstorm doesn't work because you get snow every winter. You don't get storm complexes like this (I've seen it called "Chicago's Breath Weapon" in forums) very often. - [[User:The Bushranger|The Bushranger]] <sub><font color="maroon">[[User talk:The Bushranger|One ping only]]</font></sub> 21:37, 1 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Weak support'''. I doubt a posting admin will consider deviating from standard practise in response to this comment, but I think it needs saying anyway. I consider it problematic to post this whilst the US Supreme Court ruling on healthcare is still there. Not because both stories are about the US (that is rightly a common occurance, given that the US is huge and this is the English-speaking Wikipedia), but because a convincing case can be made that neither story would have made it onto the page if they related to any other part of the world. The healthcare story in particular falls into this category, because it relates to the preservation of a status quo that we previously reported on. I would recommend that if this is posted, we at least ''seriously consider'' retiring the supreme court story early.<p>All that said, I personally consider this to be postable: a highly unusual weather event resulting in major human and physical loss/damage, generating non-trivial headlines far outside of the region. —[[User talk:WaitingForConnection|WFC]]—  22:24, 1 July 2012 (UTC)
::'''Comment''': WFC, I gather both from your comment and your spelling that you are not American.  I'm also guessing that you know little about American politics, because you've completely misjudged the notability of the health care ruling.  Common wisdom in the US is that this is the '''most important''' case heard by the Supreme Court since [[Bush v. Gore]], and many scholars think that a ruling that went the other way would have seriously, perhaps fatally, damaged the reputation of the Court and set up a collision course between the Court and the executive; hence this news is highly significant in the US.  The case is likely to be remembered for decades, and in fact is quite similar to another famous case from 1936 (the so-called "[[switch in time]]" case) where a similar dramatic shift (also by a [[Owen Roberts|Justice Roberts]]!!), saved [[FDR]]'s signature [[New Deal]] social legislation and averted an all-out war between governmental branches.  In fact, the health care ruling is far more significant than this piddly storm (and I say that despite having experienced it first hand) -- the latter will be forgotten about in a few months but the former remembered for decades. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 09:38, 2 July 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''.  I don't think this is significant enough.  Lots of similar events happen every year in the US and most get forgotten about within months if not weeks.  Doubt there will be any significant long-term repercussions. [[User:Benwing|Benwing]] ([[User talk:Benwing|talk]]) 09:38, 2 July 2012 (UTC)

*'''Posted''' I'm sure I'll catch some heat for this, but days were given to discuss this news item. The quality of the article has been sufficient for awhile, there was enough support for this to be posted, and the oppose points weren't compelling enough to overturn the support. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 19:01, 2 July 2012 (UTC)

::Not notable among Israeli ministers?  How much knowledge of Israeli politics do you have? Shamir served longer than any other Prime Minister but Ben Gurion.

*'''Support''' If we are going to put the IMO significantly less notable news about the Church of the Nativity here, we should certainly include Shamir's death. As an example of notability, the IHT (global version of NYT) had Shamir's death front page for over a day but never had the Nativity issue anywhere on the front page. Shamir was one of the main leaders of the "old guard" secular hard right of Israeli politics, which lived through the Holocaust and the 1948 war and which chose to react by refusing to compromise in almost any situation.  His passing is symbolically important in that there are probably none of that generation left any more (Begin, Rabin, Meir and now Shamir all dead, Sharon basically dead).

*'''Weak support'''  I'm satisfied the blurb is factually accurate based on the official UNESCO treatment.  Ordinarily I would oppose something like this as pretty routine but Palestine's status does add a little notability.  I'm still not madly enthusiastic about it but it seems worthy enough of a weak support.

****Agree with WFC, it's not a change to anything.  Unlike WFC, I'm still concerned with the US-centric nature of this kind of "nothing has changed but we belong in the news" article, (e.g. fifth story on the BBC homepage after multi-million pound indiscretions of Barclays, after flooding in the north of England causing death, Bomber Command being recognised in their part in ending the Second World War etc).

*******To be fair, this actually (as I've read the analyses) a major change in core US democracy is that because this was determined constitutional, this means that Congress can pass mandates like health care as a tax. (No comment if this is good or bad, just a comment).  This does have influence above and beyond health care for future congresses.  It also, as most political analysts are asserting, going to be a key issue in the upcoming elections as the Republicans are going to try to do everything in their power to vote out the Act.

*'''Oppose''' A bank in Europe is sure to garner heaps of "obvious support", but the FSA is only 11 years old, so the largest fine in the history of the agency isn't exactly a stretch. The update doesn't explain how the FSA fined £59.5 out of a total fine of £290 (who got the rest??).

:*''(edit conflict)'' I have read the news article and briefed myself on the history of the IRA and Irish-British relations. Any alleviated tensions between these two long-feuding parties would most definitely be newsworthy and notable. A symbolic handshake is just that - '''symbolic'''. It does not show that there is any trend towards unity, because the Republicans are by and large bemoaning McGuinness' act. More likely, this will go down in history as an obscure and long-forgotten PR move. If that is not so, then significant events ''will'' occur that ''are'' newsworthy and merit posting on ITN.

::*On the contrary, your extended explanation simply further justifies my comment. Yes, it is symbolic. But symbolism of this kind is precisely what so much of the peace process has been based on. Sinn Fein pointedly refused to agree to this gesture last year on the Royal visit to the ROI.

*'''Oppose''' A gesture that is possible because of what has happened over the course of many years, but not the goal to which those changes were oriented.  Peace treaties are ITNworthy: the leaders of entities previously at odds with each other having a non-decision making encounter many years later is not.

New York Times has a three page obituary written on her and discussing her impact which is an indication of clear notability. She was also active in her field until her death ([[Julie & Julia]]), and it was completely shocking as she kept her illness private. As for the Oscars, the movie industry has always been dominated by male figures and the Oscar voting usually aligns with them so it's a bit irrelevant, but she was one of a select few females who was on equal footing with them.

====[[Algo Centre Mall]] collapse====
A mall roof collapsed in northern Ontario, Canada. One is dead, one was alive as of Monday, but there's [http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1217123--elliot-lake-mall-roof-collapse-crews-work-frantically-to-find-people-trapped-beneath-rubble?bn=1 ten missing currently]. When they manage to get crews or robots into the mall's centre, and confirm causalities, can this qualify? There was no article on the mall before the collapse, and the article has 36 references so far, including an extensive section about previous issues in the mall, with the roof and parking on the roof.

Searches on Google News for "Algo Centre" in quotation marks bring up [https://www.google.ca/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=14&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=algo+centre#hl=en&tbm=nws&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22algo+centre%22&oq=%22algo+centre%22&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=serp.3...5207.6228.2.6458.2.2.0.0.0.0.79.143.2.2.0...0.0.DlqAbtX7iXo&psj=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=95c2e1461cfb95d8&biw=1440&bih=785 12,100 results].  --  [[User:Zanimum|Zanimum]] ([[User talk:Zanimum|talk]]) 23:55, 26 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''' - making international news. The number of deaths is not important as the attention this has received. It is unique both because of the remote location (nearest city of any size is 100 miles away, nearest significant city is a days drive), the politicking in the rescue effort, the severity of the collapse (how often do we hear of cars crashing through a roof?), and the humanitarian effort to rescue people and ignore the meek orders of the Ministry of Labour. - '''[[User:Floydian|<font color="#5A5AC5">ʄɭoʏɗiaɲ</font>]]'''&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">τ</font>]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">¢</font>]]</sub> 11:44, 27 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Weak Support''' - I've changed the blurb to something more standard. As those missing are now unlikely to be found alive the magnitude of the disaster is larger than a single fatality, though still relatively moderate on an international scale.

**But what is "affordable care act"?  If someone could improve the blurb so this made sense outside of those interested in it in the USA, it would be beneficial to this nomination.  What's the significance, I don't see this anywhere on the BBC website for instance.... Is this really "in the news" or is this just "in the US news"?  I strongly suggest reviewing admins allow 24 hours (or at least time for Europe to wake up and read this) before posting, the blurb at least offers no indication to the significance of this story to anyone outside USA.

SunCreator's characterization of this has been consistently wrong. I didn't just decide today that I wanted the article to be called [[Pinta Island tortoise]]. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pinta_Island_tortoise&oldid=499268040 version of the article] was clearly an article that should have been called "Pinta Island tortoise", as this common name was the primary name. And this was ''not'' just put in the article yesterday; it has been the primary and sole common name in the entire article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pinta_Island_tortoise&oldid=377200282 since July 2010] (well before even the scientific name was changed and updated in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pinta_Island_tortoise&diff=419403990&oldid=419403530 March 2011]). It has been the primary and sole common name in the body of the article since [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pinta_Island_tortoise&oldid=156217535 September 2007] (before the article was renamed from [[Lonesome George]]). Not until today did SunCreator make any effort to correct this, even though it's apparent s/he looks at and edits the article from time to time. And yet, for some inexplicable reason, (s)he has portrayed this as a mess I generated on my own for no reason.
:::::Look at the date on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pinta_Island_tortoise&oldid=499268040 the diff] you posted - it's today. I've had no reason to get involved before as the article title has been for years in line with [[WP:FNAME]] guidelines.

::::And, ''even still'', when SunCreator [[User talk:Tariqabjotu#Pinta Island tortoise|contacted me on my talk page]], I said ''I don't particularly care if you move the article back''. And guess what he said? ''My issue is not with the page move so much''. I told him that what's on the Main Page should match the article and even after being told that again on [[WP:ERRORS]], he ''still'' didn't initiate a page move (and, once again, claimed that my move was a response to something that happened yesterday). If SunCreator wanted this fixed, it would have been fixed. He either doesn't or is dragging his heels to gain more unwarranted criticism of my move and create an unneeded shitstorm. Either way, as I told him, if he wants to insult my intelligence, as he did in the discussion on my talk page, I'm not interested in helping him. There are hundreds of administrators on this site -- and he didn't even need one until an hour ago to reverse the page move -- and he chose to go this least productive route.

*'''Support''' but urge restraint in claims of this compared to previous elections.  In conversation, I would happily describe this as the first democratic presidential election in Egypt, but in an encyclopaedia the standard of examination and neutrality to which such an absolute claim is subject should be very high.  The election on 2005 was apparently flawed in many ways, but the US monitor certainly didn't denounce it as non-democratic. For us to say that this is the  "first democratic election" requires us to assert that there has been nothing democratic at all about the previous ones: we might do so in conversation, but I believe that we can't do so to an encyclopaedic standard.

*'''comment''' on my reading of ITNR it says the record must be broken after a very long time ''with a very large margin'' OR highly publicized, not long time and highly publicized.

Notable sports websites either have it buried into their Olympics sections, or have it as a little blurb on their homepage, and that's it. You have to search for "Ashton Eaton" to find it on NYT, Reuters, etc. (not on the homepage). According to [http://www.google.com/trends/ Google Trends], [[Lolo Jones]] is a trending topic right now, but Ashton Eaton doesn't seem to be getting attention outside of [[Eugene, OR]] (his hometown) and for some reason he's popular in [[Estonia]] (maybe Google Trends is a bad reference), but anyways it doesn't look like it gets a lot of social attention.

*'''Support''' I want to oppose this as sports trivia, but Bzweebl is right, it clearly passes ITN/R criteria for a broken record. If we can post some footballer scoring 60 goals in a season, we can post this. To the objections above: 10 years is a very long time. How is it not? What would be a very long time? 15 years? 20? The counter for this event is now reset to zero, do we have to wait another 20 years to consider posting to WP? The last one was in 2k1, there was no WP to post then, so a mens decathlon world record has by definition not been posted to ITN. We're not flooded with them.

There's a story like this on the front page of my local newspaper, incidentally, and only WP:POINT is stopping me from nominating it just to prove the point.

*'''Oppose''' This has already been posted once and nominated who knows how many times.  This is primarily a US domestic story of little wider significance.

:Yes, I say that even taking account of Spencer's comments - for a start you can ''always'' find an obscure international page nowhere in the site's running order covering a story internationally, that is simply the nature of the web.  Here, the BBC's coverage is not British but in the US and Canada area of their international site.  Many of the others are simply recycled newswires and two point to exactly the same page.  A couple of the other appear to be little more than content scrapers of the form we wouldn't accept as sources.  If this is the top international coverage such a lack of investment in covering it is actually indicative of a ''lack'' of international notability.

*'''Oppose''' reposting a wire story on bbc.co.uk does not make the coverage or interest international. I found a Times of India article for the Miami face eater.

::His status within computer science is what makes ''him'' noteworthy, not what makes these ''events'' noteworthy.  In any case why should we post specifically ''because'' of his status within the field?  That, or the fact that other tech-orientated websites are marking this, does not mean we should.  Almost the reverse in fact, we have to be careful over issues of systemic bias in an area it is generally acknowledged we tend to over-represent.

:::I disagree - his status within computer science '''is''' what makes these events noteworthy. So, slavishly follow the trend of "general news websites" and avoid at all costs copying our techy pals (so that we look more serious)?

::::It isn't a question of "slavishly following the trend", it is about differentiating between items of general interest and specialist topics.  The anniversary (not the events that mark it) is being covered in the sci-tech and IT press but is attracting comparatively little interest generally.  We post perhaps 10-15 items a week.

*****{{ec|3}} <small>[For the love of God, please use the Preview button.]</small> Three quarters of the game were over by the time it was nominated. Most of an update could have been completed by that time or by the time the game was over. It didn't have to be, but there is no point to adding supports to or nominating an ITN/R item when there's no simultaneous updating. It's not a badge of honor to nominate articles for ITN. It's not about showing how excited one is about the game. And, frankly, the fact that the article didn't have something so basic as the score more than ten minutes after the end of the game is a sign of slow updating. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 04:36, 22 June 2012 (UTC)
****** Some of us enjoy actually watching the game, not spending it typing in front of their PC instead of watching the game on TV. The necessary update was given to the article, you posted it, and all is well in the world of ITN and the NBA. As someone who devotes as much time to Wikipedia as you do (I really do appreciate all the work you and the other admins put into Wikipedia, by the way), if the fact that the score of the game wasn't added as fast as you would have liked, you could have added it on your own. -- [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|cont]]) 04:59, 22 June 2012 (UTC)
******* It's not the score that's important; it's that it's indicative of the speed of the update. People tend to jump over each other to be the first to update the score for big sporting events (and with the Super Bowl, commentary is sometimes updated in realtime), so when that hasn't been done -- yes, even after just 10-15 minutes -- it bears repeating that the article update is what's important. (Note that last year, the score was in the article before it was nominated here and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2011_NBA_Finals&diff=433986219&oldid=433986182 before the game ended].) You waited until the end of the game, and that's fine, but others did not. And if they just decided during a commercial break to come to Wikipedia to nominate the item or offer up support (perhaps as a way of expressing excitement about the outcome or being first to "call it") and then go back to watching the game, that's really not helpful. It's already on ITN/R, so its notability is already established. It's great that you updated the article, but I don't want to encourage a culture where simply supporting the notability of an item on ITN/R is seen as moving an item a step closer to being on ITN. In some situations, even with such goading, it takes ''ages'' for a prose update (beyond just a score) to materialize, and then we get complaints about why the item hasn't been posted yet. To be honest, the fact that you updated it so quickly is a bit remarkable. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 05:42, 22 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''  If there was one 100m race every six months, and the world record was broken more often than not on these occasions, we would not post such records.

** As noted by above, this is like a record that is broken maybe every two years (maybe even moore's law 18 months, but...) so it's not a frequent changeover. But importantly it is not a individual record but the fact that numerous agencies came together to fund and construct the computer, something that takes a lot of time and money to complete.

***That's 4 times in 6 meetings of TOP500 ( a little over 2 1/2 years), not "maybe every two years".

*******No it doesn't. The nomination is a press release, not an event, and certainly not news.

********Technically, the Voyager I story a few days ago was all from a press release by NASA. Yet it gained wide coverage across numerous news sources because those sources felt it was a significant merit of human achievement, even though it wasn't a true "event".  Now, I am well aware that press releases can be taken as commercial ads (for example, with Microsoft's introduction of the Surface tablet yesterday, I refuse to accept that that would be considered as an ITN since its basically an ad for MS), but we're talking about something far from a commercial endevour, but as a scientific advancement.

*'''Oppose''' I don't see any real milestone having been breached here: it doesn't represent any kind of order of magnitude improvement, nor is it revolutionary on a fundamental basis.  Which computer is fastest is something that alters rapidly - 15 times in the last 19 years - as part of the regular performance gains seen by computers generally.  The "news" element here does not relate to a matter of substance - i.e. it ''becoming'' the fastest non-secret computer - but its place in the TOP500 rankings, which are only updated every six months. We have a tendency to post far too many computing stories here as it is: we should be more selective, restricting our coverage to game-changers or genuine milestones.

*'''Comment''' I don't understand the opposition to this. These are exactly the type of items that the minority topic "technology" is meant for. Not some idiotic apple gadget, but a 16 petaflop super computer. It took years to develop, build and test. It's also not an incremental update of the previous K computer, it's completely different. These high speed computers are used in weather modeling, astrophysics and various geo-political struggles (ie cypher breaking) and have a substantially greater impact than 60 football goals in a season or 100 test cricket centuries. It will probably have a greater impact on the course of human events than the bailout of a worthless bank in a failed state.

***The logic that "new technology is always better than old and therefore not news" basically means any story about science and technology - always advancing on previous work - should be incapable for ITN.  And by similar logic, there will always be a winner in an election, or a winner in a sports event, so we should never cover those as well in ITN.  We need to get out of this mindset that ITN must be current events. It needs to be about current stories but that need not necessarily be about events from the last week or such.  We also have to recognize that when scientific progress is highlighted by non-scientific sources for the layperson that that means that there's more to it than just standard scientific progress. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 16:35, 19 June 2012 (UTC)
****A large number of stories involve some sort of quantitative metric, with the story being that X is larger/smaller/longer/shorter than has been achieved before.

*'''Oppose''' It's not often that I agree with Lihaas but tonight, we're speaking almost the same language. Yes, Rodney King has a very important place in history, and is one of the most significant figures in the US in the circles of crime, policing and race relations. In most ordinary circumstances we would put him on the front page. But - and this is the issue for me - he went from being a significant person in the fight against institutional racism into a spiral of abuse and criminality, ending up on reality television and dying, it seems, by his own misadventure. He was not at the forefront of the fight he had started. Whilst the beating by police was shocking and historically important, his life veered off-piste almost immediately afterwards. He was not a figure which could be used to show the best of humanity after adversity. As such, it would be illogical for us on grounds outside ITN's tick-boxes to give him front page prominence.

:*"10 times as many of our readers..." needs "citation needed" after it, to be honest. The objections have been pretty well phrased in my opinion - he was  a victim who received world wide infamy, and from the beatings came a step-change and attitude shift amongst American police. But from that one frame in time he entered a very unfortunate 'spiral' into Z-list celebrity, drink addiction and criminal activity. There is nothing in his life after the incident for which he is known to suggest he was held in high enough esteem to meet our criteria. On that basis, he shouldn't be on the front page under ITN and you shouldn't be so eager to snap at those of us trying to make a broad case for our opinion [[User:Doktorbuk|doktorb]] <sub>[[User talk:Doktorbuk|words]]</sub><sup>[[Special:Contributions/Doktorbuk|deeds]]</sup> 22:59, 17 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''': Does not meet death criteria. Heights of bias when people compare this death to the death of the Crown Prince, Deputy PM and Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia.

*'''Bias''' If we are going to make having lived a morally upright life a criterion here at ITN, lets have some explicit standards.  I hardly think someone being an alcoholic makes him a monster compared with being the fat and pampered son of a religious dictator and a supporter Al Qaeda.  But that's just me.  As for the 10 x 1 interest, I had been going by Google hits, but I see just now that [[Rodney King]] has garnered 423,233 hits in the last day ''without being on the front page'', while the prince has garnered about 52,000 on average over two days.  I expect the editors who asked for refs showing our readers care more about [http://stats.grok.se/en/201206/Rodney%20King Rodney] than [http://stats.grok.se/en/201206/Nayef%20bin%20Abdul-Aziz%20Al%20Saud Nayef] will change his vote?

*'''Oppose''' Doktorbuk is right here. If King became a national spokesperson for police brutality or human right abuses or so forth this would have been easily supported here and posted. However he didn't do anything of note after the trial and the riots, and became mostly tabloid fodder which is sad, but not noteworthy. I'll support similar cases in ITN of figures that became internationally famous for a tragic event and made a notable impact afterwards e.g [[Phan Thi Kim Phuc]].

I also notice that there has been a lot of editing of his article since his death, which is more than can be said about many other ITN items that linger at ITN/C pending an article update. King may not be an important person by his own doings, but as an icon, still, and as a symbol of racial conflicts in the U.S., I think he's important enough for his death to be presented at ITN. __[[User:Meco|meco]] ([[User talk:Meco|talk]]) 06:46, 19 June 2012 (UTC)

** There was, and the result was so close that no government could be formed, hence this second election. The issue is not that though; the result of the election could be massive. The country could also effectively become bankrupt if the parties rejecting the EU/IMF bailout deal win a majority and carry out their policies - this would probably lead to Greece withdrawing from the Eurozone and/or the Euro, with associated massive implications for Europe as a whole (indeed, some commentators have said it could possibly lead to the collapse of the Eurozone as a whole due to the loss of investor confidence for countries with large indebtedness, notably Spain, Portugal and Italy).

:::Yea, somewhere in looking up (probably the NASA update) there are like 5 other man-made probes that ''may'' have gone this far.

This 'claim' could be made next month or year, such is the way of science and space. It's a marker, yes, but it's not really ''an event'' I can see fitting onto the front page under 'news'.

** The event of V1 leaving the solar system (by ''some'' definition) is certainly one of significance. The problem is that we have no idea what that mark is, whether it is this current point, reaching the heliopause, or whatever; all this has been only theory and  even this point was a mark with a 3 year estimated window for when it would have been reached.  So our hands are tied if we are looking for a harder marker to report this as news.  Given that this "phase" of traveling the heliosphere is expected to take a few more years, we won't likely have any update for this for that time.  If it were the case that this was the first of several known events in close timing, then like other similar ITN items, we'd wait until the most significant point. We simply have no idea if this could be the case here. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 05:59, 17 June 2012 (UTC)

But that's not the only reason I 100% support including this right on the main page as a front row story. Prince Nayef was [[Ministry of Interior (Saudi Arabia)|Minister of Interior in Saudi Arabia]], which means he was in charge of the country's national security.

He was a major proponent of fundamentalist Islam within the royal family. In addition to that, the ailing health of [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|the King]] and the death of Prince Sultan has made Nayef arguably the chief decision maker in the country for the past eight months or so, if not even before that.

This man had many innocent people killed over the years and was cowardly enough to facilitate the funding of al-Qaeda in exchange for their word not to stage any attacks on Saudi Arabia (check out ''The Eleventh Day: The Ultimate Account of 9/11'' by non-fiction author [[Anthony Summers]], the evidence is simply too compelling to ignore).

:::@Medeis &mdash; I'm not sure where in my argument you derived "Saudi national pride", or anything of the sort. Nayef is notable for so many different reasons, as I've outlined above. Not just because he was Minister of Interior for 42 years (overseeing things like the [[Grand Mosque Seizure]], for instance), or even because he was Crown Prince at the time of his death (albeit for 8 months, but regardless), but also the fact that he had such a strong presence in virtually all the day-to-day functions of Saudi Arabia. He headed the Supreme Council on Information, the Supreme Committee on the Hajj, and was arguably the most influential of all deputy Prime Ministers and of the [[Sudairi Seven]]. His influence was paramount in all corners of domestic policy, he had a major hand in the direction of foreign policy, and he even dabbled somewhat in state expenditures.

But I also thought it irrelevant since none of the things which may make him interesting on the national stage bring him to ITN level.

| nom cmt      = Niagara Falls is considered the "holy grail" of tightrope walking and Wallenda become to first to do it (a few people crossed over Niagara Falls gorge during the 1800s, but that is completely different in terms of length and difficulty.)  The Falls present several unique challenges: the wire can't be secured, as is normal, meaning it sways more than normal; the winds are swirling and unpredictable making balance much harder; the wire is wet and the pounding mist makes visibility near zero in the middle.  It took two years of pressure just to get the permit approvals - most people thought it would be impossible to ever get them and officials are on record as saying it will be at least 20 years before they grant another permit.  It short, this is an exceptional feat that likely will not be repeated in the foreseeable future.  Incidentally, update won't be an issue as I intend to take the article to GA quality.

*'''Oppose''' this is a ''stunt'', nothing more.  As the nomination attests the novelty value is due to legal and procedural hurdles as opposed to any inherent difficulty.

:*Of course it was a "stunt" ''by definition''. The harness was not by Wallenda's choice, but a requirement of the broadcast deal.  Ultimately, it had no effect.  If he fell, his reputation would have been ruined, destroying his livelihood, so the risk was still very great.

:::''Nobody'' forced him to wear the harness, it was his choice to accept the TV deal and by extension his choice to take the harness.  The fact that he did shows where the real priority was: lining his pockets with silver.  Ultimately, that is almost a side point though, people haven't been eagerly anticipating the possibility of someone doing this for decades, it is simply something the media have whipped up a frenzy about and that ultimately changes nothing of any broader significance.

*'''Oppose''' I am with Crispmuncher on this. There is 'advancing human endeavour' and then there is 'getting a sponsored publicity shot'. Nothing here really impresses me - people have been getting their mugs in local papers for climbing up walls since the invention of the camera.  ITN is not supposed to be about "self generated headlines", which is why we tend to dismiss protest movements for what they are. This is the same ballpark - nothing here shouts out at me as notable, it's a gimmick, a stunt, and will be forgotten by next month never mind next year.

For whatever it is worth at this point - (1) This particular stunt is a risk to life, harness notwithstanding, (2) Niagara Falls significantly defines itself by its history of stunters, and many stunters have defined their own achievements in terms of Niagara Falls, (3) A century's ban on Niagara Falls stunting was overthrown to allow this crossing, (4) first time ever directly over the falls themselves. Those elements, taken together, make this crossing unique enough in the history of stunting to be noteworthy. As to a milestone of human endeavour - apparently there still are people willing to open new frontiers at the risk of their own lives. (If we at Wikipedia are not to be a crystal ball, it is also not ours to assess the long-term value of any particular frontier.) Incidentally, some protest movements could also be considered the same way. However, the political lenses do need to be removed first, before any neutral assessment of notability. - Tenebris 07:34, 19 June 2012 (UTC)

:This nom is a loss of solid crdibility cause we dont mention race/ethnicity as POV. At any rate nothing expecially notable of a financial convict (as he now is). Thereve been many. Stanford/Madoff were bigger[[User:Lihaas|Lihaas]] ([[User talk:Lihaas|talk]]) 18:08, 15 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support''' - I am inclined to support the story (with a better blurb) ''if'' an extensive update happens.  This is the resolution to major criminal trial and the biggest business story of the day. (There is [[Raj Rajaratnam/Galleon Group, Anil Kumar, and Rajat Gupta insider trading cases|an article]] about this plus the parallel cases, which might be the best place for a large update.) --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 18:22, 15 June 2012 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' What is wrong with the blurb? [[User:Truthsort|Truthsort]] ([[User talk:Truthsort|talk]]) 18:32, 15 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Support'''- I want to oppose, but Gupta has had such a major influence on the economy over the years, making this far more notable than an ordinary case of fraud, although the update is still insufficient. Additionally, we don't have to bold it because it is a mediocre article, but [[Raj Rajaratnam/Galleon Group, Anil Kumar, and Rajat Gupta insider trading cases]] can be linked to in the blurb. '''[[User:Bzweebl|<font color="#D60047">B</font><font color="#F0A000">zw</font><font color="#00A300">ee</font><font color="#0A47FF">bl</font>]]'''  ([[User talk:Bzweebl|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bzweebl|contribs]]) 18:59, 15 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''. I'm sorry, but this is nothing like the Bernie Madoff or Allen Stanford stories. Who was hurt? What is the compelling interest? Plus the [[Raj Rajaratnam/Galleon Group, Anil Kumar, and Rajat Gupta insider trading cases]] article is unreadable. [[User:Speciate|Speciate]] ([[User talk:Speciate|talk]]) 20:05, 15 June 2012 (UTC)
:*First of all, why does someone have to get hurt in a conviction other than the convicted? The compelling interest is his fame and importance, which is indubitably widespread. Also, [[Raj Rajaratnam/Galleon Group, Anil Kumar, and Rajat Gupta insider trading cases]] will probably not be bolded, so it doesn't need to be a well-written article, but if we post it on the front page as a normal link, it creates the possibility that someone will come along and improve it.

*'''Oppose''' Firstly as ThaddeusB has noted the blurb does nothing to put this story into context or assert its notability.  If a blurb can't capture the attention of our readership it isn't ITN worthy.  Secondly even ''after'' reading the article in full I am still left wondering as to why this should be considered  notable enough for ITN inclusion: it seems a fairly mundane insider trading case.  The ethnicity of the defendant is a complete irrelevance unless it is somehow directly related to the nature of the offence or the handling of the case against him. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 03:16, 16 June 2012 (UTC).
*'''Support''' [[Goldman Sachs]] board member guilty of insider trading of [[Warren Buffet]] securities?  What could possibly be a bigger corporate criminal case than this? I am not quite sure I understand the comment, but is Lihaas actually saying that to post this would be racist?  Not to post this because the convict is not an Anglo is what would be racist. [[User:Medeis|μηδείς]] ([[User talk:Medeis|talk]]) 04:13, 16 June 2012 (UTC)
:: He was referring to adding the phrase "American Indian" in the blurb. For example, the nominations below dont use "Gambian black woman Fatou B. Bensouda succeeds Luis Moreno Ocampo as Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague" or "Caucasian American Financier Allen Stanford is sentenced to 110 years in prison for his Stanford Financial Group Ponzi scheme". While it may not be racist, I dont think his ethnicity warrants a mention unless for some reason that increases the notability (like it would have if the issue involved multiple countries or international relations). [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 08:49, 16 June 2012 (UTC)
:::[[American Indian]] is not the same as [[Indian American]]. That being said, he was born an Indian citizen and is now an American citizen. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say "Indian-American" in the blurb. If he were born and raised in the United States (and, therefore, born and raised a U.S. citizen -- India does not permit dual citizenship), then it would certainly not be appropriate. -- '''[[User:Tariqabjotu|<font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font>]]''' 14:53, 17 June 2012 (UTC)
:::: My bad on the use of the phrase.

***Will there still be a club called 'Rangers' in the SPL? Playing at Ibrox?

AFAIK, there is a chance that Rangers will remain a club in the SPL, but there are a number of other possible outcomes, such as being forced down to the 3rd division.  I do think Rangers are a notable enough club to consider posting if the latter happens.  While not as strong as top clubs in England, Spain, etc, they have a worldwide fanbase at least in the English-speaking world and have a far greater notability than, say, a perennial mid-table EPL team.

*'''Oppose''' I had to mull this over for a while, but in the end it's no more notable than a major league team in the USA being sold or folding. The most successful title highly subjective. I've seen the same thing said about LFC and Man-U.

It just seems to be attracting a lot of attention even without special events. Soccer is also commonly believed to be (as far as I know) the most widespread/adopted sport.

*'''Support once updated''' Any claim of corruption in boxing has no place here, and should not sway the consensus. Corruption gets brought up for a lot of the election results we post, but ultimately it's not our place to judge whether a sport is corrupt or not when it comes to ITN nominations. ITN is all about showcasing notable current events and the work put forth by users to update these articles. This was a highly notable and anticipated boxing match, reguardless of its outcome. You can even argue that the outcome made it even more notable than before, as the nominator suggested. Once updated, it meets ITN criteria, and I believe it should be posted. However, we should keep an eye on any updates to the article, because there is a strong chance of neutrality issues occurring.  -- [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|cont]]) 06:15, 10 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' All I know about this fight based on watching threads in forums is that 1) it was a technical defeat (judge-ruled) which is less impressive than a KO/TKO victory and 2) that decision is itself appears to be more significant than the outcome itself because many believe (journalists, fans, and even his opponent from PR statements) that Pacquiao should have won it.  The controversy over this appears to be the subject of news rather than the actual victory.  This is one that I would give the media a bit more time to settle down over the matter (1/2 day) and then reassess what is the ITN matter that really is of interest here. --[[User:Masem|M<font size="-3">ASEM</font>]] ([[User Talk:Masem|t]]) 13:47, 10 June 2012 (UTC)
**It would have been a very significant outcome even if it were totally non-controversial.  Pacquiao's strength and fame as a boxer is roughly on par with Mike Tyson; the closest comparison I can think of would in fact be Douglas defeating Tyson, which was remarkable and uncontroversial.

*'''Support'''. The article seems well updated. The "one governing body" argument is worthless. We post all sorts of Football pageants: FIFA, Premiere, various regional federations, and other arbitrary events like that Japanese championship last year. If the "one governing body" criteria was strict, we would post FIFA world cup and thats it. Since we don't, then that's not a rule, and this can go up.

*'''Support''' - I understand that boxing organization is "a mess", but I don't think that is sufficient reason to exclude all boxing.

*'''Oppose''' For a start the researchers were very careful about their claims in the first instance - they ''didn't'' claim anything but asked for comments and for people to look for flaws in their experiment.  Secondly this is simply one more nail in the coffin for that particular (non-)finding: it was basically discredited months ago. [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 20:04, 8 June 2012 (UTC).

::Discrediting and refuting is not the same.

[[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] ([[User talk:The Rambling Man|talk]]) 20:53, 8 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Weak support''' This brouhaha has been a major science story despite the anticlimactic conclusion. One of the problems I think we have with science news is that some editors oppose initial findings as not sufficiently proven to be notable, while others oppose later official statements as not surprising enough to be notable, as the initial findings had already been announced. This isn't a critique of either group, just to say that it makes it hard for us to post something from stories that move at this pace. In this case, I'd support this blurb's front page appearance on the merits of the story from start to finish, not solely on today's announcement. The conclusion is anticlimactic, I'll grant, but it's still been an interesting and widely publicized chapter of scientific history. Plus, the article has what looks like a high-quality update.

*'''Support in principle''' I know nothing about this field but a quick perusal of the linked articles suggests a genuine leading figure within it.  Sure, he's obscure but that is the nature of his field of endeavor: ''notability'' is not the same thing as ''fame'', which is a point often lost when discussing yet another celebrity death.  On the other hand the update amounts to all of a single sentence.  That would need to be expanded before this can be posted.

*'''Oppose''': I thought sub-national elections were a strict no-no unless it is ground breaking. Ok, so an attempt to recall a governor of one of the 50 states failed. I would recommend against keeping the threshold for posting sub-national elections so low. Conceded, that it has received somewhat prominent coverage in some of the news websites - but as doktorb pointed out, most of these news websites discuss this in the context of the upcoming US presidential elections. There are also enough news websites that dont feature this prominently [http://rt.com/], [http://dawn.com/], [http://www.thehindu.com/news/] - while news reports are indicative of notability, they are not the only parameter for determining notability.

*'''Oppose''' per Lihaas. Recall elections are [[Recall_election#United_States|fairly common]] in the USA, albeit not for the governor.

*'''Support''' Recall elections are '''rare'' in the US, and the fact that this was "pre-sold" as a harbinger of the presidential elections, and that record amounts of money were spent by both sides (people forget that the signature gathering etc. was expensive), the election ''per se'' is noteworthy (no matter who wins - it is silly to say that if one party wins it is more notable than if another wins) [[User:Collect|Collect]] ([[User talk:Collect|talk]]) 11:42, 6 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' I just don't get the above rationales. It's just a "local election", despite involving more people (6 million) than a good chunk of the election news we post; it shouldn't be posted because recall elections for ''local city council elections'' have been common in the past, even though it's rare for governors and to survive one is unprecedented; it's "nonnotable", despite being reported on around the world, because an Indian newspaper that doesn't have any non-India news on its front page didn't have this on its front page; it has no repurcussions despite being preceded by some of the largest mass protests in recent US history and was widely described as a referendum on the future of unions. It's hard to see what US political news could meet our criteria short of Scott Walker eating his opponent's heart on live television after declaring victory, but perhaps even that would be more of a local interest thing. [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 13:14, 6 June 2012 (UTC)

*** '''(1)''' Regarding what US political news will be considered notable for ITN, like every other sovereign country, general elections in USA and election of the head of state of the USA will be considered notable. And because USA is a super power and other countries have interest in US political developments, I suppose that with adequate consensus may be the election of the presidential candidate of the Republican Party and Democratic Party can also be considered as notable. '''(2)''' Regarding prominence in an Indian newspaper, the point I was trying to make was the exact opposite, let me quote from my previous comment: "while news reports are indicative of notability, they are not the only parameter for determining notability". Different newspapers cover the news differently. You gave examples of 2 British and one Qatari news websites where it is featured prominently. I gave examples from Russian, Pakistani and Indian news websites where it isnt. If your issue was with the main page not having any international news, the [http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ international section] does not feature it prominently either. '''(3)''' Regarding the state having a population of 6 million, we did not post the elections of a state having a population of 200 million this March on the grounds that it was only a sub-national election. So an argument that it involves more people is hardly a card that you can you play to your favour. '''(4)''' I will concede that it is unique because a governor surviving a recall is unprecedented in the USA, so while it does contribute towards notability, being unique doesnt make it automatically notable. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 14:37, 6 June 2012 (UTC)
****Sorry if my last post was grouchy; it's been a rough day IRL. I don't mean to suggest that any of the above make this "automatically notable", simply to observe that the goalposts are being moved when it comes to U.S. subnational elections compared to almost any other story. I've never before seen a post where something is a lead story at CNN, NYT, BBC, and Al Jazeera, but people still argue it to be "of local interest only". As a quick thought experiment, if a plane had crashed in Wisconsin yesterday, killing 100 people, it would have been very likely to hit the front page; at the very least, it's hard to imagine editors saying, well, vehicles have crashed before, plus this Pakistani newspaper doesn't seem to be covering it. Yet the long saga of the union battles and mass protests that culminated in this recall has received hundreds of times the coverage that such a crash would, impacts far more people, and is infinitely more likely to be discussed by future historians and encyclopedias. Doesn't that equate to greater notability, by any reasonable definition?
****The main problem here appears to be unwritten precedent about subnational elections. But if precedent blocks us from reporting notable events in the news, perhaps it's time to break that precedent here at In The News? I realize this is unlikely to pass at this point, but just wanted to say my piece. [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 17:42, 6 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''' Ok, normally I wouldn't support this type of news, but this has made it to 2 major German news outlets (in addition to the various ones already mentioned); obviously not because Wisconsin has risen to the top of Germans' hearts, but because of its potential impact on Obama's re-election - see here: [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/gouverneurswahl-in-wisconsin-republikaner-walker-siegt-in-recall-a-837191.html Spiegel]; [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/us-praesident-verliert-stimmungstest-obamas-verheerende-pleite-in-der-provinz-1.1375723 Süddeutsche]. BTW - I disagree with Khazar2's argument about precedent. While it is clear that ITN/R-listed elections are considered notable ex officio, my understanding is that all other elections - including provincial ones - can be discussed on ITN/C and, if considered noteworthy enough (and sufficiently updated) by the community, may be posted. [[User:Khuft|Khuft]] ([[User talk:Khuft|talk]]) 22:33, 6 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose'''. I might have supported this the day after, but it is just too late now. Also, the consensus of opinion is that the result has no connection on Obama's reelection chances, so it's too local. [[User:Speciate|Speciate]] ([[User talk:Speciate|talk]]) 23:05, 9 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment re TFA''' It's great that [[Transit of Venus]] is going to be TFA on the day. However, TFA articles are often about non-current events, or not even about events. Without an ITN entry most readers, seeing only the first line or two of TFA, won't know that it's actually happening "now". I still argue for this to be in ITN to highlight its currency.

*'''Strong support for simultaneous inclusion with TFA''' - Good god, we are AN ENCYCLOPEDIA, and possibly the most used learning tool for the English speaking world outside of schooling. This is exactly the type of rare scientific event that we should be plastering around for the whole 24 hours that it is occurring. I think the one or two additional lines can be spared to make it more apparent that it is happening. It certainly has been making the news regularly for the last several weeks. - '''[[User:Floydian|<font color="#5A5AC5">ʄɭoʏɗiaɲ</font>]]'''&nbsp;<sup>[[User_talk:Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">τ</font>]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Floydian|<font color="#3AAA3A">¢</font>]]</sub> 21:35, 4 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Weak oppose''' generally, '''strong oppose''' to simultaneous inclusion with today's FA and '''vehement oppose''' to inclusion before the event has even taken place.  Astronomy as a whole is replete with once in a lifetime events: I could look around and find you a dozen events that take place today that will not re-occur for another millenia, another dozen for tomorrow, another dozen the day after that and so on ad infitum.  The "once in a lifetime event" argument is therefore meaningless and in this case isn't even true, given that is is fair to imagine any contributor here is at least 8.
:However, I am most animated about this attempt to jump the gun on this, starting with a ridiculously premature nomination and now this notion that we should post early to "spread the word" about it happening.  How can there be any update before the event has taken place?  An update in this context is something that occurred either during or after the transit and that could not have been predicted with any certainty before it: that allows for the confirmation of a specific hypothesis but not simple extrapolation of Newtonian or relativistic mechanics.  '''If''' an update meeting those criteria (which are our usual criteria) is made I'll have no problem reconsidering, but simple listing of times of first/last contact don't fit the bill since they are projectable well in advance.  Yes, Floydian, we are an encyclopedia, with ENCYCLOPEDIC VALUES.  We do not jettison long-standing core values for short-term sentiment.

::Demanding an update is just fucking ridiculous. Astronomers have known about this event on this date for a century. There is NOTHING to update. What fucking drugs are you on?

::::Since when has a nomination's "prematurity"  been a reason for opposing it when it becomes timely?  Arguing that all sorts of unique astronomical events occur is irrelevant to the fact that this is a ''named'' type of event the importance of and rarity of which are both quite notable.  The article has already been updated by 1100 bytes in the last two days.  It would be quite easy to add another three referenced comments such as the fact that the transit will be covered live by NASA.  Such updates to the article do not need to wait until after the event has occurred.

::::::To respond to Hilo first, arguing that there won't be an update is an argument ''against'' posting.  Policy is clear: we do not post without an update.  An update in this context is something that can only be added either during or after the event itself to address Richerman's point: experiments can and will have been planned months ago.  Information on them may have been more difficult to obtain until recently, but there is little that wasn't known months ago and could have been put in the article if anyone had bothered to do the leg work: that isn't an update but regular article building.  The provisional results of thse experiments would qualify and I'm sure they will be widely reported.  If we hold off until then there's a good chance someone will actually put the work in to ensure that this ''can'' be posted: highlighting updating content is one of ITN's core reasons for being.  Posting anything we feel like because it seems like a good idea at the time is not.
::::::As for the premature nom, no that is not by itself an argument against posting, but the argument that this somehow deserves an early posting certainly is.  Let's be clear on this: the update requirements are there for a reason.  Posting without those requirements being met is to throw the policy book out of the window. 
::::::Finally, this "one of the rarest predictable events" thin is nothing more than press hyperbole and weakens the referenced article in my view. There are plenty of rarer astronomical events that occur over much longer time scales. There was a particularly close approach between Earth and Mars only a few years ago that will not be bettered for 30,000 years. Which is rarer, ''that'' or something that last occurred only eight years ago? [[User:Crispmuncher|Crispmuncher]] ([[User talk:Crispmuncher|talk]]) 02:53, 5 June 2012 (UTC).
:::::::About the Martian approach. No human alive has seen anything like this more than once (transits of Mercury are much smaller, less rare and less scientifically important). Mars' close approach in 2003 however looked ''pixel for pixel identically good'' to telescopic (or naked eye) observers as close approaches that happen every 15 or 30 years! Only space probes and radar can do such hair splitting ("50000 years!") This has a name, is a recognizable category of event and is notable enough to be one of the first 270 featured articles, the Mars thing doesn't have any, other than [[opposition of Mars a visually indistinguishable margin better than approaches which occur every 15 or 30 years]], or [[Close approach of Mars]]. [[Opposition of Mars]]? Some people may hyperbole but this is truly on the short list of the most important astronomical events (probably not discoveries) of the century.

Policy may be clear (although where it says updates to articles must occur after real world events is unclear), but it is also ''flexible'', Crispmuncher.  This is one of those cases.

:IAR is not carte blanche to do what the hell you like.  The net result of invoking it must still be within the general aims and objectives or ITN specifically or at least the project generally. A case for doing so has not been made.  That isn't to say that a case ''couldn't'' be made, only that it has not been.  OTOH I am struggling to imagine what it would be that would over-ride the stated aim of the section to highlight updated content.  An implicit "go out and watch this" is not one of our aims, and in any case we are already doing so in a manner consistent with policy in the featured article.  It seems to me that for ITN we ''need'' an update to move this story from being essentially an interesting but pointless curiosity to something of some value.

*<s>'''Oppose'''</s> '''Neutral''' - I'm willing to hear counterarguments for his extreme notability, but I'm not fully sold by what's listed in the article so far. His death appears to be treated in the first English news sources I looked at as trivia--Time, for example, discusses him only in terms of being a meme.

**Your source describes him as ''The subject of one of the Internet's most beloved memes''. I'd say this is already a sign of some exceptional notability. Then, of course, Khil is mostly known as a meme to Anglophones, but in Russia and post-Soviet states he is known as one of the most prolific Soviet era singers. [http://lenta.ru/articles/2012/06/04/hill/ Here] he is described as one of the symbols of the Soviet popular music. The same could be said only about very few living Russian/Soviet singers. While being a Soviet era star may not be notable enough for ITN, the combination of his domestic fame with his (rather specific) international fame makes him an interesting ITN subject.[[User:Greyhood|<font color="darkgrey">Grey</font><font color="grey">Hood</font>]] [[User talk:Greyhood|<font color="black"><sup>Talk</sup></font>]] 18:43, 4 June 2012 (UTC)
***Okay, you make a fairly good case. His death does appear to be prominently featured in English-language Russian news sources, and for things besides the meme. I don't really have the skills to search in Russian, unfortunately. I agree that his Soviet-popularity alone would have almost made me vote support, though not convinced his meme-dom puts him over the top. (I don't see the Wikipedia of the future putting up [[Gary Brolsma]]'s death from old age, for example, though he's arguably an even more famous meme.) As somebody who's actively been lobbying for ITN's pop culture coverage to have a more global reach, though, I at least won't stand in this one's way.

*'''Support''' Do you know what, maybe I've gone mad, maybe it's the two sugars in my tea or the lack of natural sunlight, but I'm going for this. He is not notable to the full extent that we expect (or indeed I would usually expect to be honest). However, I can't help thinking that we're pretty good here at having at least one finger on the pulse of what the Internet is talking about. I'm pretty sure that the burst of condolences are real, he had a short, sharp and sudden moment of fame on line and attention around the world, not just the usual places either. I would usually shoot these nominations down, it's just I have a niggling doubt that there's something very.....Wikipedian about it, so for the sake of his long career, the unusual circumstances of its revival and the reaction, not to mention the cult status he achieved via YouTube, let's get him on the front page.

*Did Rock and Roll have influence internationally? If so, then Dick Clark did so as well. If it hadn’t been for his show American Bandstand, there wouldn’t have been the huge growth of RnR in the early 60! And that’s not including his New Year’s Eve TV specials that were watched yearly by 100s of millions around the world! To claim he’s just not important outside of the US, is to deny his importance in rock and roll and rock’s importance/influence on the globe.
If an editor claims a person is important enough to be posted here, isn’t it incumbent on the other editors who don’t know that person to look him/her up and decide for them if the import criteria is met? Not just “I’ve never heard of him/her.” I know I do. Maybe we can learn a little about important figures of the past in the process ourselves.
To deride me by claiming that only I’m saying “he’s not important in my country”, while also claiming that this particular person’s really only famous in his country (besides a relative celebrity through an internet meme), seems to me to be ridiculous. If Dick Clark is only important in the US not the rest of the world, therefore we can’t post his death, to then turn around and say that Mr. Trololo is really popular in Russia and therefore should be listed makes me say WHAT!???!!?
Again, I struck by the lunacy of all of this and just don’t need the stress! I have way to much stress IRL and don’t need this added to it. So, I’m done. I’m fed up beyond the pale.

*'''Oppose'''. This is systematic bias at its finest. An Internet-saavy group believes the death of someone known primarily for his Internet fame meets guidelines of widespread notability. This seems to have made the news, especially on English-language news sites, as a footnote or a trivia item. It does not meet our standards of notability, especially for deaths. The support comments read to me as either (a) using the Internet meme as a measure of notability (which I don't think is enough) or (b) claiming he is very well-known in Russia. The latter is a bit more reasonable, but that seems like skirting around Option (a). The [http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C,_%D0%AD%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 Russian version] of this man's article doesn't seem extremely long or well-presented, even by Russian Wikipedia standards, ([http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena_Gomez their article] on [[Selena Gomez]] is about as well-formed), and our article here is even worse.

No opposition if his contribution to Russian music is such that he would be deemed to have a comparable impact in that genre to that of Robin Gibb in Western Anglophone music, but an in joke among a group that is greatly overrepresented among our editors (but not our readers) adds a miniscule amount to his ITNworthiness.

*'''Comment''': If Eduard Khil is indeed as notable in Russia as it appears from his article (winner of Russia's most prestigious artist award, the People's Artist of Russia; toured over 80 countries; Order of Merit for the Fatherland, etc), then it is in fact systemic bias to presume he is notable only because of the Trololo song, because that is what the Western world knows him for. A possible equivalent that comes to my mind is [[A. R. Rahman]] who is an absolute legend in India but known in the Western world primarily for his work in Slumdog Millionaire for which he was given a ton of awards, whereas most of whom who follow Indian (Tamil, Hindi) music will probably consider his work in Slumdog as waaaay below par. So if Eduard Khil is in fact notable in Russia for his other work (I wouldnt know; I've only got his article to go by), to keep him out by presuming he is notable only  as "Mr. Trololo" would be systemic bias.

Neither was Mr. Khil in a high-ranking office of power, nor was he "widely regarded as a very important figure" in his field, at least not globally, as there are many singers in the world who are much more notable. Nor has his death "a major international impact that affects current events".

*'''Comment'''. We have slightly more support votes here and the topic, in the aspect of being related to an internet meme, might be considered fairly interesting, rare, and minority one. Could we add this news at least to the middle of the template - it will slip from there soon anyway? I'm pretty disappointed to see the talk about some Internet-related systemic bias above. Surely the main bias here is that news related to notable persons, especially singers, artists and writers, from non-Anglophone countries have much lower chances to get posted. Khil's was even honoured by the Russian President: "His name is connected to an era in the history of Russian music. Eduard Khil was unique in his extraordinary charm and lyricism, constant in his professionalism, vocal culture and creative taste. Many of the songs he performed became part of the golden fund of the Russian stage." I'd say his notability on the Russian/Soviet level is pretty clear, and the international notability related to the meme makes him OK for posting on ITN.

*'''Oppose''' Wasn't Israel already believed to have nuclear-equipped subs? I notice that the Wikipedia article linked here already includes that they do, despite not having been updated for two weeks. On a quick skim, it appears the story here is simply that Germany is selling Israel nuclear-capable subs--not that Israel didn't have them already. Which might help explain why this isn't getting more prominent coverage (doesn't appear to be in today's New York Times or BBC, for example). But the article hasn't been updated yet; maybe a high quality update can convince me. (And on a picky note, the blurb in any case should read not that Israel has added nukes to subs, but that they've been reported to have done so; that's the event that specifically happened today.)

::Israel is widely believed to have nukes and Israel has subs capable of holding missiles which could carry nuclear war heads, this has been known for years. The reason I nominated this is that this is the first time it has been reliably reported that Israel is now ''actually doing'' what we have known for several years it was capable of, placing nuclear missiles on its new subs. I believe this is at least as important of a development as the single report we posted which stated Iran may be thinking of building nuclear weapons, or North Korea's weapon testing a few years back, also posted probably. I will try to update with the sources I added above. [[User:Unique Ubiquitous|Unique Ubiquitous]] ([[User talk:Unique Ubiquitous|talk]]) 09:21, 7 June 2012 (UTC)
:::FWIW, Der Spiegel appears to be reporting that Israel has had nukes on subs for some time--not that they started doing it this week. ("Berlin has long been aware of that.") I feel pretty much the same about this that I did about the "NYT reports Israel responsible for Stuxnet" nomination; this was something everybody already pretty much knew, that's now getting a slightly more official report from a single publication. Here, for example, is a Wash Post article from 2006 pointing out that Israel had bought new nuclear-equipped submarines and was planning to use them as insurance against Iran (and owned some even before that): [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/24/AR2006082401050.html].

It was a day for breaking records; this was the biggest flotilla recorded by Guinness World Records, beating the previous holders in Bremerhaven, Germany, who managed a mere 327 vessels the day after last year’s Royal wedding."

*'''Oppose''' Already proposed once and shot down. IIRC "most popular browser" is dependant on way of measuring, and in some measurement some-other-browser is the most popular browser around anyway. And wasn't Firefox already the most popular browser ahead of IE? [http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp] Anyway, not the most reliable statistic (single source).

*'''Oppose again''' 1. Usage share is an estimate based on user agent strings sent to web servers. Some sites (such as w3schools) are biased towards users who would seek an alternate browser. 2. Public web servers can't take into account corporate users forced to use MSIE for intranets, having no access to the internet. 3. Chrome didn't "beat" MSIE. Webkit+Gecko+(whatever operas layout engine is) beat MSIE. Lastly, to Hilos point, Google is the #1 search engine and spams you pretty hard if you go there without using Chrome. It's not as if users thought "I should use an alternate web browser", it's more a case of "Google said to use this for internet".  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:IP98|IP98]] ([[User talk:IP98|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/IP98|contribs]]) 23:29, 1 June 2012 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

*'''Comments''' this is not like changing the favorite brand of ice cream at all since people don't eat ice cream several hours every day, and ice cream is not part of the every day life. This has a larger impact on the world than who won the world chess championship or what new chemical elements are accepted. Actually it has a bigger impact on the world than any of the items posted now, including the Syria massacre. It is notable because IE has been uncontested in being the most used browser since it beat Netscape a decade and a half ago. In some sense it is like some athlete beating one of the very old world records in some semi-obscure race. And I am reminding people that we DID post the launch of the ipad 2 last year.

*'''Oppose''' As Hydrox said, this was suggested a few weeks ago, and shot down because of the same reasons. It's a hard statistic to track, you'll get a different answer on market share depending on the source, the statistics don't account for the fact that IE comes built into the majority of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PCs, and it's not really a statistic that matters. Is the most popular web browser really an important statistic that should be considered ITN worthy? It's really no different than a statistic about the most popular color of cars. In fact, I believe that because of the low-impact nature of these statistics, posting this would be a borderline advertisement for Chrome, [[WP:SPAM|something that shouldn't have a place on Wikipedia]]. Hell, I use Chrome, but I don't really care what web browser others use, because in reality they all take you to the [[Internet|same place]].-- [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|cont]]) 07:25, 2 June 2012 (UTC)

Stuxnet was a milestone worm. It now is revealed by a respected and extremely conservative newspaper (The New York Times) that the US and Israel was behind. Some people consider cyberattacks the equivalent of physical attacks, so by that metric the US has attacked Iran - that is major news.

*'''Comment'''. Ordinarily I would support, but I think you will run into trouble with that blurb. People on ITN tend to prefer 'watershed' moments, such as people dying and teams winning championships, and politicians getting elected; this evidently is not one of those 'watersheds' so I can't see it getting a go, despite the fact that the story is interesting and probably of "wide interest".

*'''Support''' per Thule, but the article needs work. Orange banner, still says "US suspected" (if it's confirmed, the prose needs updating), and some reactions would be nice. --[[User:IP98|IP98]] ([[User talk:IP98|talk]]) 23:32, 1 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Support''': Notable for reasons mentioned by others above. It has also received adequate news coverage: [https://news.google.co.in/news/story?hl=en&gl=in&q=stuxnet&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ncl=dBz2UWWgnvJBH0MSN8O9UXulqiVbM&ei=65HJT5jZAYb5rQfwqZS9Dg&sa=X&oi=news_result&ct=more-results&resnum=2&ved=0CDYQqgIwAQ]. [[User:Chocolate Horlicks|Chocolate Horlicks]] ([[User talk:Chocolate Horlicks|talk]]) 04:13, 2 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' For two main reasons reasons. First, the NYT article claims in paragraph 6 that this information is "based on interviews over the past 18 months with current and former American, European and Israeli officials involved in the program, as well as a range of outside experts. None would allow their names to be used because the effort remains highly classified, and parts of it continue to this day." How reliable is this? That kind of source is very unreliable, seeing as how any news outlet could just piece together something like this based on speculation and politically-skewed opinions. Unless I hear the white house confirm this ([[Classified information|which won't happen]]), or a more reliable source of information is given that proves it ([[Classified information|which also isn't likely to happen]], unless someone at the [[CIA]]/[[DIA]] falls asleep in their cubicle), I would deem this to be pure speculation. Not everything that comes from the NYT has to be the truth (same with any other media outlet) unless the information can be proved without a doubt, which the article fails to do. There's no doubt that the US and Israel may have created it, but unless it's a proven fact, it's just speculation. Speculation is not news, and should not be found on ITN. The fact that this is getting media attention is irrelevant in this case because of these reasons. Second, there are several orange tags on the article, and the article reads as though the event is speculation (which, again, I believe it is). I don't see any reference to the article, except for one sentence in the lead (not enough of a prose update).-- [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|cont]]) 08:07, 2 June 2012 (UTC)
:*As your quote says "''current and former American, European and Israeli officials involved in the program''". People actually involved in the program should be reliable sources. So unless the NYT made up the "involved in the program" (this is where I invoke the NYT's reputation), I consider US and Israeli involvement a proven fact from this point on.

::*NYT easily passes [[WP:RS]]. --[[User:IP98|IP98]] ([[User talk:IP98|talk]]) 10:48, 2 June 2012 (UTC)
:::*NYT is considered a reliable source, but having just that source alone does not in itself satisfy verifiability nor notability (and they've been wrong before). Why hasn't [[Al-Jazeera]] posted anything about this? If it's such a huge story, you would think ''they'' most certainly would.--[[User:WaltCip|WaltCip]] ([[User talk:WaltCip|talk]]) 14:37, 2 June 2012 (UTC)
:::::In my crazy and strange rant, I wasn't trying to imply that NYT was a poor source, but when I read an article, I don't like to see anonymous names as sources. I understand it's classified information that was released, but I still prefer to see sources with names. -- [[User:Anc516|Anc516]] ([[User talk:Anc516|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anc516|cont]]) 01:21, 3 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Mild oppose''' - I don't have any problems with NYT reporting, which is A+ standard, but this doesn't seem to be receiving much international attention, perhaps because this revelation had been widely assumed anyway. (For example, Israel reportedly listed Stuxnet as one of the accomplishment's of a retiring general at a farewell bash last year.) [[User:Khazar2|Khazar2]] ([[User talk:Khazar2|talk]]) 20:18, 2 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Strong Support''' This has been a long time international story of wide interest to our readers.  The virus's provenance has long been suspected, but if it has been confirmed, the story is quite newsworthy. [[User:Medeis|μηδείς]] ([[User talk:Medeis|talk]]) 22:59, 2 June 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose''' – I wouldn't word it as "revealed" when it's only been reported by one news outlet, no matter how reliable. See [[Hitler Diaries]]. <b style="color:white; background:darkgreen">—[[User:Cliftonian|<b style="color:white; background:darkgreen">Cliftonian</b>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Cliftonian|<b style="color:white; background:darkgreen">(talk)</b>]]</b> 19:23, 3 June 2012 (UTC)
:*So we have one oppose above by Khazar2 above, with the argumentation that this was already widely know, and therefore not news. And one oppose by Cliftonian here, with the argumentation that we don't know if it is true :P. [[User:Thue|Thue]] | [[User talk:Thue|talk]] 11:41, 4 June 2012 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I mean while I have no problem with the article or anything at all, I have a small problem with the use of "discovered" since they were created, not found in nature.  I would suggest altering the wording from "recently discovered synthetic elements" to "recently synthesized elements" but that's just my opinion.
